	Bump version to 0.6.9

2019-06-13  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix to "Remove EBDB-Message buffer after killing..." etc

	* ebdb-message.el (ebdb-message-quit-ebdb): This way of doing it makes
	 sure the `quit-window' only fires when the EBDB buffer is actually
	 visible.

2019-06-12  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix bug in popup buffer window splitting

	Fixes #77

	Thanks to Alan Schmitt for reporting.

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-pop-up-window): Size of popup window should be a
	 function of whether we're splitting horizontally or vertically, not
	 whether the original window is wider than it is tall.

2019-06-12  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	New command ebdb-format-these-records

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-format-these-records): New command formatting all
	 the records currently displayed in the EBDB buffer.
	 (ebdb-mode-map): Bind "F" to this command instead of
	 ebdb-format-all-records, as it's more useful.
	 (ebdb-format-to-tmp-buffer): Remove spurious &optional.

2019-06-12  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Remove EBDB-Message buffer after killing or postponing message

	* ebdb-message.el (ebdb-message-quit-ebdb): New function that finds
	 and quits the EBDB-Message window.
	 (ebdb-insinuate-message): Add this function using
	 `message-add-action'.

2019-06-11  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Have ebdb-pop-up-window better honor ebdb-default-window-size

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-pop-up-window): There was still a hard-coded 0.5
	 in here. Check ebdb-default-window-size for all its potential
	 values.
	 (ebdb-popup-window): Fix docstring to mention that the return spec
	 can also include a direction symbol.

2019-06-11  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix dumb bug in gnus and message window config

	* ebdb-gnus.el (ebdb-gnus-window-configuration):
	* ebdb-message.el (ebdb-message-reply-window-config):
	(ebdb-message-reply-yank-window-config): Needed backticks and commas.

2019-06-10  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Give all MUAs their own version of ebdb-default-window-size

	Related to bug#77 on Github.

	* ebdb-gnus.el (ebdb-gnus-window-size):
	* ebdb-message.el (ebdb-message-window-size):
	* ebdb-mhe.el (ebdb-mhe-window-size):
	* ebdb-mu4e.el (ebdb-mu4e-window-size):
	* ebdb-rmail.el (ebdb-rmail-window-size):
	* ebdb-wl.el (ebdb-wl-window-size): Add new options, all defaulting to
	 ebdb-default-window-size.  Where necessary, add new defgroups, and
	 ebdb-popup-window methods.  Change ebdb-wl customization group to
	 ebdb-mua-wl, to match other groups.
	* ebdb.org (Pop-up Buffers): Document.

2019-06-10  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Further error with slots as keyword vs symbol

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-read): Can't keep this straight...

2019-06-10  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix docstring of ebdb-popup-window

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-popup-window): No longer uses half the window,
	 mention `ebdb-default-window-size'.

2019-05-31  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	New command ebdb-create-record-and-role

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-create-record-and-role): New convenience function
	 for creating a new record and adding a role all at once. Really need
	 some way of differentiating the prompts.
	* ebdb.org (Role fields): Document.

2019-05-31  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix some plist-get calls to use tags, not symbols

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-read): These were supposed to be unified as tags.

2019-05-31  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Use previous object as default when editing anniversary field

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-read): Most of the other fields already did this...

2019-05-31  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Quit EBDB window after message is sent in mu4e

	* ebdb-mu4e.el (ebdb-insinuate-mu4e): mu4e also uses message mode. In
	 Gnus, we don't need to quit the EBDB buffer because Gnus recofigures
	 the windows for us. In mu4e, do it manually.

2019-05-31  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix functions for browsing anniversary dates

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-field-anniversary-calendar,
	 ebdb-field-anniversary-agenda): Both of these should show the *next*
	 upcoming occurrence of the anniversary. Also, there was a bug in the
	 agenda function: it expects a string, not a list.

2019-05-30  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	New option ebdb-default-window-size to control popup sizes

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-default-window-size): New option, float between 0
	 and 1.
	 (ebdb-popup-window): Use it in the default no-specializers method.

2019-05-20  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix snarfing dumbness, bump to 0.6.8

	* ebdb-snarf.el (ebdb-snarf-query): Not sure what I was thinking here,
	 that's not how `add-to-list' works. A simple `push' should suffice.
	* ebdb.el: Bump and flush.

2019-04-19  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add ebdb-open command, improve docs, bump to 0.6.7

	Thanks to David Masterson for suggestions.

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-open): New command that just opens a new *EBDB*
	 buffer.
	 (ebdb-search-display): Provide more helpful hints if user has no
	 records.
	* ebdb.org: Expand introductory section of manual.

2019-03-13  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix compiler warnings

	Mostly unused dispatch vars.

	* ebdb-format.el (ebdb-fmt-compose-fields): But also a couple of real
	 bugs in the usage of pcase here.

2019-03-13  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix usage of choose-completion-string-functions

	* ebdb-message.el (ebdb-insinuate-message, ebdb-insinuate-mail): Just
	 use add-hook with LOCAL.

2019-03-10  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Tweak completion support

	The gist of this is that it provides two kinds of completion support: 
	the `ebdb-dwim-completion-cache' which is simply a list of "name
	<mail>" strings for use in mail composition buffers, and the
	`ebdb-record-completion-table', which is a general-purpose completion 
	table for selecting a record.

	Squashed commit of the following:

	commit 5f55a397da48d58ff411c509cc0105e1f2b60ac0 Author: Eric Abrahamsen
	<eric@ericabrahamsen.net> Date:	  Thu Mar 7 18:13:55 2019 -0800

	    Remove option ebdb-wl-use-ebdb-completion

	    * ebdb-wl.el (ebdb-insinuate-wl): We've already got the option
	     ebdb-complete-mail for this.

	commit 1776b0275e4c2d20713ba3a36ec849d3bb19a936 Author: Eric Abrahamsen
	<eric@ericabrahamsen.net> Date:	  Thu Mar 7 16:50:57 2019 -0800

	    Arrange for post-completion stuff to be called even with capf

	    * ebdb-message.el (ebdb-message-complete-mail-cleanup): New function
	     that simply passes the correct arguments to
	     `ebdb-complete-mail-cleanup'.
	     (ebdb-insinuate-message): Add the above to a buffer-local value of
	     `choose-completion-string-functions'.

	commit efaafa1cd438e41bbcab1fd6ed8a3c32922294d0 Author: Eric Abrahamsen
	<eric@ericabrahamsen.net> Date:	  Thu Mar 7 12:02:15 2019 -0800

	    Docstring fixes

	<eric@ericabrahamsen.net> Date:	  Thu Mar 7 12:01:52 2019 -0800

	    Update docs about completion options

	commit 84b8b3d707a02196e71ba447cf7df294a088e285 Author: Eric Abrahamsen
	<eric@ericabrahamsen.net> Date:	  Wed Mar 6 13:41:30 2019 -0800

	    Make more interesting completion table, remove some functions

	    * ebdb-com.el (ebdb-record-completion-table): This function now uses
	     the string to complete as an actual search.
	     (ebdb-completing-read-record): Simplify this record somewhat;
	assume
	     that there's only one matching record.
	     (ebdb-completing-read-records): Delete this function, there isn't
	     really a use for it.

	commit 74e34625d6b9e0db4cd8ae5b00645364a1591f1c Author: Eric Abrahamsen
	<eric@ericabrahamsen.net> Date:	  Thu Jan 17 10:41:51 2019 -0800

	    WIP on manual updates

	commit 9892a4401d9c16f50c3f52fdb4dc86550ca4ff9d Author: Eric Abrahamsen
	<eric@ericabrahamsen.net> Date:	  Wed Jan 16 12:21:44 2019 -0800

	    Turns out the completion functions could be simpler

	    * ebdb-com.el (ebdb-record-completion-table): So *that's* what
	     `complete-with-action' is for.
	   * ebdb.el (ebdb-mail-dwim-collection-function): Here, too.

	commit 52cbe9e94aa0f4acb4480ec75b87632c85c30ce9 Author: Eric Abrahamsen
	<eric@ericabrahamsen.net> Date:	  Mon Jan 14 13:57:50 2019 -0800

	    New completion mechanisms, next bit

	<eric@ericabrahamsen.net> Date:	  Fri Dec 28 13:44:21 2018 -0800

	    WIP on new completion mechanisms

2019-03-06  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Remove unused function ebdb-get-records

	* ebdb-com.el: This wasn't used anywhere.

2019-01-29  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Simplify regexp in ebdb-dwim-mail

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-dwim-mail): Use the [:punct:] construct.

2019-01-22  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix international parsing of phone numbers, bump to 0.6.5

	* ebdb-i18n.el (ebdb-parse): Was using `replace-match' when it wasn't
	 certain that `string-match' was getting called first. Not sure how I
	 haven't run into this yet.

2019-01-19  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Update vCard formatter classes, bump to 0.6.4

	Fixes #75

	* ebdb-vcard.el (ebdb-formatter-vcard): Forgot to update for the new
	 formatters.

2019-01-17  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Don't add Gnus window configurations if ebdb-mua-pop-up is nil

	Otherwise, Gnus will still open an empty window, even if EBDB doesn't 
	think it's popping up.

	* ebdb-gnus.el (ebdb-after-load-hook):
	* ebdb-message.el (ebdb-after-load-hook): Move the config into the
	 ebdb-after-load-hook.

2019-01-15  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Bump to 0.6.3, flush recent changes

2019-01-15  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Re-absorb ebdb-counsel into main package

	* ebdb-counsel.el: Contains function ebdb-counsel. Preparatory to
	 deleting separate counsel-ebdb package.

2019-01-08  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Move map require from ebdb-com.el to ebdb.el

	Fixes #73 (I hope)

	* ebdb.el: The map patterns are also used in ebdb-format.el, need to
	 require them top-level.

2018-12-30  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix compose fields for the HTML5 freeform formatter

	* ebdb-html.el (ebdb-fmt-compose-fields): This didn't need to be so
	 complicated; also you're allowed to have multiple <dd> elements for
	 a single <dt> element.

2018-12-30  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Allow 'mail-primary as an argument to ebdb-record-field

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-record-field): There will be more of these later, but
	 I've already started using these in the new formatters, without
	 having pushed this change.

2018-12-30  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Make csv-mode dependency optional

	* ebdb-format.el (ebdb-formatter-csv): Declare function and check it
	 exists.

2018-12-29  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Provide basic HTML5 freeform formatter

	* ebdb-html.el (ebdb-html-formatter-html5): New class, uses definition
	 lists for field instances.
	 (ebdb-html-default-formatter-html5): New option.

2018-12-29  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Shift base ebdb-fmt-record implementation to ebdb-formatter-freeform

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-fmt-record): This behavior is common to most
	 freeform formatters.
	* ebdb-format.el (ebdb-fmt-record): So define it here.

2018-12-29  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Refactor formatter classes, add tabular formatters

	* ebdb-format.el (ebdb-formatter-freeform, ebdb-formatter-constrained,
	 ebdb-formatter-tabular): New formatter classes separating out
	 different behavior.
	 (ebdb-fmt-field-label): Make the record argument optional.
	 (ebdb-formatter-csv): CSV formatter.
	 (ebdb-default-csv-formatter): New option.
	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-formatter-ebdb): The EBDB formatter inherits from
	 ebdb-formatter-freeform.
	* ebdb-org.el (ebdb-org-formatter-tabular): Add Org table formatter.
	 (ebdb-org-default-tabular-formatter): New option.
	* ebdb-latex.el (ebdb-latex-formatter-tabular): Latex table formatter.
	 (ebdb-latex-default-tabular-formatter): New option.
	* ebdb-html.el (ebdb-html-formatter-tabular): HTML table formatter.
	 (ebdb-html-default-formatter-tabular): New option.

2018-12-29  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Allow overwriting of previous formatting buffers

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-format-to-tmp-buffer): This was the point of
	 giving different formatters their own buffer name -- we /should/
	 overwrite previous formatting buffers of the same type. Users can
	 save them if they've got what they want.

2018-12-29  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Docstring fix for ebdb-mail

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-mail): Use automated documentation tools.

2018-12-23  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Switch from cond to pcase in ebdb-record-field

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-record-field): Preparatory to making this method more
	 interesting.

2018-12-23  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Rejigger insertion of newlines in record formatting

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-fmt-record, ebdb-fmt-record-header,
	 ebdb-fmt-compose-fields): Fairly classic error re making sure there
	 are always newlines in the right place.

2018-12-19  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Bump to 0.6.2

	Mostly to flush the migration upgrade.

2018-12-18  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	defvar bbdb-time-stamp-format

	* ebdb-migrate.el (bbdb-time-stamp-format): Quiet the compiler.

2018-12-18  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Remove reference to ebdb-fill-column

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-redisplay-records): Leftover from an earlier
	 experiment with filling.

2018-12-18  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	New function ebdb-parse-search-string

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-parse-search-string): New function that parses a
	 string containing multiple field values to search against into a
	 list of search cells. Don't actually do anything with this yet.

	At some point, when we support AND searches, this will be handy.

2018-12-18  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Update migration process to handle BBDB file format 9

	* ebdb-migrate.el (ebdb-file-format): Now handles up to 9.
	(vrecord): New slots for uuid, timestamp, and creation-date.
	(ebdb-migrate, ebdb-migrate-vector-to-class): Handle.

2018-12-18  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Use nth 2 instead of caddr

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-pop-up-window): Not available in Emacs 25? It's
	 annoying to look at, anyway.

2018-12-18  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Call signal correctly

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-record-related): Needs two arguments.

2018-12-17  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Move ebdb-format-to-tmp-buffer from ebdb-format.el to ebdb-com.el

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-format-to-tmp-buffer): This command only makes
	 sense in the context of an *EBDB* buffer, thus belongs in this file.

2018-12-17  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Adding too many newlines in multiline view

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-fmt-compose-fields): Now that it's mapc instead of
	 mapconcat, we've already got one trailing newline, only need to add
	 one extra.

2018-12-17  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Use org-tags-history when reading org tags fields

	* ebdb-org.el (ebdb-read): Slightly nicer.

2018-12-14  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Refactor record formatting

	The main change being dropping ebdb-fmt-record-body and 
	ebdb-fmt-compose-field in favor of new method ebdb-fmt-compose-fields, 
	which returns all fields as a single string.  First step towards 
	allowing fields to have their own sub-fields.

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-indent-string): Remove function, this is now done
	 with filling and indenting.
	 (ebdb-fmt-record): Now returns strings instead of inserting them.
	 Collects fields and calls ebdb-fmt-record-header and
	 ebdb-fmt-compose-fields.
	* ebdb-format.el (ebdb-formatter): Give formatters their own
	 format-buffer-name slot, so they don't trample each other.
	 (ebdb-fmt-compose-fields): New method that turns all fields into a
	 single string.
	 (ebdb-fmt-compose-field): Delete function.
	 (ebdb-fmt-record-body): Delete function, its job is now done by
	 `ebdb-fmt-compose-fields'.
	 (ebdb-fmt-process-fields): Change return value from a list of plists
	 to a list of alists. There are more fun toys for working with
	 alists, like the map-* functions and pcase macros.
	 (ebdb-format-to-tmp-buffer): Robustify.

2018-12-14  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Protect against databases with no records, bump to 0.6.1

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-display-records): New databases will contain no
	 records, don't assume there are any.
	* ebdb.el: Bump to 0.6.1

2018-12-14  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Forgot to reverse the list of collected fields in formatting

	* ebdb-format.el (ebdb-prompt-for-formatter): They've been collected
	 backwards.

2018-12-07  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Small manual tweaks and typo fixes

2018-12-07  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Don't exit ebdb-mua-in-ebdb-buffer during minibuffer input

	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-mua-in-ebdb-buffer): Probably I just should have
	 fooled with quit-restore rather than doing it this way.

2018-11-24  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Use ebdb-foo-in-list for the fast lookups check

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-search): We want to be able to handle subclasses and
	 all that, as per usual.
	* ebdb-org.el: This chunk is no longer necessary, as
	 `ebdb-org-field-tags' subclasses `ebdb-field-tags'.

2018-09-24  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add a ebdb-fmt-field implementation for images

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-fmt-field): This used to be hard-coded.

2018-09-21  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Exclude full formatter from `ebdb-available-ebdb-formatters'

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-available-ebdb-formatters): The full formatter is
	 selected with its own function, the toggle/loop shouldn't use it by
	 default.

2018-08-05  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-add-to-list): Move macro before first use

2018-07-27  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Bump to 0.6 and flush

2018-07-27  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Use register-read-with-preview in ebdb-mail-each

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-cite-records-ebdb): No reason to make something
	 up, this function does just what we want.

2018-07-26  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	New option ebdb-gnus-post-style-function

	* ebdb-gnus.el (ebdb-gnus-post-style-function): Callable allowing
	 users to set up Gnus posting styles depending on the recipient
	 record of a message.
	 (ebdb-field-mail-compose): Method specialized on value of
	 `read-mail-command'. Runs the above function and optionally sets the
	 value of `gnus-newsgroup-name'.
	* ebdb.org: Document.

2018-07-26  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Quote custom type

	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-mua-default-formatter): It complained about use as
	 a variable.

2018-07-26  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add new ebdb-mail-each command to ebdb-mode

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-mail-each): New command for sending a separate
	 email to multiple records.
	 (ebdb-mode-map): Bind to "M".
	* ebdb.org: Document.

2018-07-25  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Refactor record mail commands

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-record-one-mail): The main thing being replacing
	 `ebdb-prompt-for-mail' with new function `ebdb-record-one-mail'.
	 There are now three main functions for producing mail addresses from
	 a record: `ebdb-record-mail' returns them all (depending on
	 arguments), `ebdb-record-one-mail' returns a single one (which one
	 determined by args), and `ebdb-dwim-mail' returns a string mail
	 representation of the record. The senses of function arguments have
	 been swapped around to minimize the number of arguments that have to
	 be passed in the most common cases.

2018-07-13  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add a "prompt" argument to ebdb-prompt-for-record

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-prompt-for-record): We need to be able to customize
	 the prompt.

2018-07-11  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	New option ebdb-mua-default-formatter

	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-mua-default-formatter): New customization option
	 governing which formatter is used by default in MUAs.	Defaults to
	 `ebdb-default-multiline-formatter'.
	 (ebdb-mua-update-records, ebdb-mua-display-records,
	 ebdb-mua-auto-update): Use new option here. (Why are there so many
	 different functions that do pretty much the same thing?)
	* ebdb.org: Document.

2018-07-11  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Bump to 0.5.4

2018-07-11  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Replace eieio-object-name-string with ebdb-field-label

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-field-label): Now that we're not using `eieio-named',
	 we shouldn't be using this method. Replace it with a custom method.
	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-fmt-field-label, ebdb-copy-fields-as-kill): Change
	 calls.
	* ebdb-format.el (ebdb-fmt-field): Change calls.

2018-07-11  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Remove duplicate defvar

	* ebdb.el: `ebdb-i18n-countries-pref-scripts' was defvar'ed twice.

2018-07-10  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Be more careful about testing against user mail addresses

	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-mua-test-headers): This can derail the whole
	 process if works incorrectly (eg, user has no mail address), so put
	 more thorough checks in place.

2018-07-10  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix to "stop using eieio-named"

	* ebdb.el (initialize-instance): Should have tested first...

2018-07-10  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Stop using eieio-named as a mixin to provide labelling

	Apparently this was a misuse of eieio-named and its 'object-name slot.

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-field-labeled): This class is now a simple mixin, and
	 provides both the 'label (formerly 'object-name) and 'label-list
	 slots.
	 (initialize-instance): Upgrade field instances and databases to use
	 the new slot name.
	* ebdb-format.el (ebdb-formatter): Formatters should also not inherit
	 from eieio-named; their slot name is also renamed from 'object-name
	 to 'label.
	* ebdb-com.el:
	* ebdb-migrate.el:
	* ebdb-test.el:
	* ebdb-vcard.el: Rename slots everywhere.

2018-07-09  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Turn ebdb-add-to-list into a macro that calls cl-pushnew

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-add-to-list): This function only existed to behave
	 like `add-to-list', except ignoring a nil element argument. It's now
	 a macro that uses the cl-pushnew macro, so the whole thing can get
	 compiled away as much as possible -- there might be some minor
	 speedups at load time.

2018-06-25  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Change write-contents-functions to ebdb-save-ebdb

	* ebdb-com.el: Forgot to change this when I split ebdb-save-ebdb off
	 from ebdb-save: the former is the right one to call in this
	 situation.

2018-06-25  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Remove bogus ebdb-mode-hook defcustom

	* ebdb.el: The hook is automatically created in ebdb-com.el.

2018-06-13  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Use apply instead of eval on phone number formatting

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-string): There was no reason for this use of `eval'.

2018-06-12  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Bump and flush: 0.5.3

2018-06-12  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Document customization options for *EBDB* buffer display

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-default-oneline-include): Add a new option for the
	 oneline include. Delete a mysterious duplication of
	 ebdb-default-multiline-include.
	* ebdb.org: Document some/most of the options.

2018-06-11  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Tweak default formatter settings

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-default-multiline-formatter): Forgot to include
	 the :combine and :collapse slots.
	 (ebdb-default-oneline-formatter): Only show the primary mail by
	 default.

2018-06-09  Henrik Pingel  <knowhy@users.noreply.github.com>

	Update README.org (#70)

	add link to ebdb.org

2018-06-09  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Move defmethods beneath all classes used as specializers

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-init-field, ebdb-delete-field): If they specialize on
	 ebdb-record-person, they need to appear in the file after that class
	 is defined.

2018-06-08  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix to "add nicknames to person record cache"

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-init-field, ebdb-delete-field): Was using the wrong
	specializer.

2018-06-08  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Further improvements to snarfing

	* ebdb-snarf.el (ebdb-snarf-routines): Make sure the mail address re
	 doesn't pick up trailing punctuation.
	 (ebdb-snarf-collect): Keep track of found fields so we don't collect
	 multiple identical field instances.
	 (ebdb-snarf-collapse): Remove spurious variable, fix logic of
	 collapsing: only dump names and fields out if there's no record.

2018-06-07  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Let the typos begin!

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-delete-field): Test first, then push.

2018-06-07  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add nicknames to person record cache 'alt-names

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-init-field): For simple name fields and person
	 records: also store a combination of "nickname surname" in the
	 cache's alt-name, so people can search and complete on that.

2018-06-07  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Make "record" argument to field init and delete non-optional

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-init-field, ebdb-delete-field): There is no location
	 where we're not passing in the record, and we want to be able to
	 specialize on it. Change for all definitions.
	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-init-field, ebdb-delete-field): And here.
	* ebdb-i18n.el (ebdb-init-field, ebdb-delete-field): Same for the
	 extra methods here.

2018-06-07  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	New command ebdb-save-ebdb

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-save-ebdb): New command that calls `ebdb-save' and
	 then maybe marks all buffers as unmodified.
	* ebdb.el (ebdb-save): This is no longer an interactive function, and
	 doesn't mess with buffers.

2018-06-07  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Improve name parsing

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-lastname-re): Better regexp for matching surnames with
	 hyphens and apostrophes.
	 (ebdb-divide-name): Check for all-caps UN-style surname. Also, now
	 returns given names as a list.
	 (ebdb-parse): Complex name method assumes given-names are
	 already a list.
	* ebdb-test.el (ebdb-parse-name): Add more test cases.

2018-05-17  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Rework formatter include/exclude routines

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-foo-in-list-p): Rename from ebdb-class-in-list-p, and
	 turn into a generic method, with implementations for both classes
	 and objects. Handle "shortcuts" like 'mail for 'ebdb-field-mail, and
	 'role-not-defunct for ebdb-field-role instances that aren't defunct.
	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-default-multiline-include,
	 ebdb-default-multiline-exclude, ebdb-default-multiline-combine,
	 ebdb-default-multiline-collapse): New customization options allowing
	 users to set these things without having to message with classes and
	 slots. Do not document until we've also figured out the 'sort and
	 'header slots. The former should handle these shortcuts, the latter
	 should go away altogether.
	 (ebdb-default-multiline-formatter): Draw the default
	 slot values from the above options.
	* ebdb-format.el (ebdb-formatter): Leave the relevant slot :initforms
	 at nil. Defaults should come from the
	 `ebdb-default-multiline-formatter' option.
	 (ebdb-fmt-process-fields, ebdb-fmt-collect-fields): Adjust for new
	 behavior.

2018-05-17  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Display message when reformatting a single record

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-reformat-records): Say that we're doing it.

2018-05-17  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Redisplay records after customizing a mail field

	* ebdb-com.el (eieio-done-customizing): The :around method runs
	 with-record-edits, but this :after method happens _after_ that,
	 meaning that we still need to redisplay the record.

2018-05-17  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Rework field sorting

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-field-compare): New method for comparing/sorting
	 fields. By default, don't change order.
	 (ebdb-field-compare): Remove old (unused) function
	 `ebdb-sort-mails', and replace with new method for mail fields.
	* ebdb-format.el (ebdb-fmt-sort-fields): Instead of fretting about how
	 to correctly sort mails when editing the database, just do the
	 sorting at display time. Fields are now sorted first using
	 `ebdb-field-compare', then the formatter sort order. Use seq.el
	 sorting functions, instead of my homemade bird's nest.
	 (ebdb-fmt-process-fields): Make sure combined field instances
	 maintain sort order.

2018-05-07  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Use ebdb-string on new mail addresses in ebdb-annotate-message

	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-annotate-message): Otherwise it dumps the actual
	 mail object into the minibuffer and then disappears it, which is
	 awfully distracting.

2018-05-07  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix ebdb-mua-edit-sender-notes

	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-mua-edit-sender-notes): Update to new calling
	 convention for ebdb-with-record-edits.

2018-05-06  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Don't clobber TAB in message-mode

	* ebdb-message.el (ebdb-insinuate-message): The whole point of the
	 previous line, which manipulates message-completion-alist, is that
	 you don't need to clobber TAB.

2018-04-24  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Make field customization more robust

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-customization-record): Rename variable from
	ebdb-custom-field-record.
	 (ebdb-customization-field): New variable doing equivalent
	record-keeping.
	 (ebdb-edit-field-customize): Have customization act on a field
	 clone, rather than the field itself.
	 (eieio-done-customizing): Once customization is complete (on the
	 cloned field), then try to change the old field for the new field,
	 in an atomic way.
	 (eieio-done-customizing): Use ebdb-with-record-edits to both handle
	 un-editable records, and record redisplay.
	 (eieio-done-customizing): Use the new record-keeping variable.

2018-04-24  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix post-delete mail manipulation

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-record-delete-field): This needed to check if there
	 actually *is* a mail field to act on, and also wasn't actually
	 setting the priority properly.

2018-04-23  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix to snarfing collapse

	* ebdb-snarf.el (ebdb-snarf-collapse): The two clauses handling fields
	 and names were meant to both be protected under the (when record...
	 clause.

2018-04-21  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Use inhibit-read-only

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-display-records, ebdb-redisplay-records): Instead
	 of let-binding buffer-read-only.

2018-04-21  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Be smarter about displaying appended records

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-display-records): When records are appended to an
	 existing buffer, we almost certainly want point to end up on them.
	 Record the uuid of the first additional record, and try to move to
	 its marker after redisplay. Additionally, use `recenter' instead of
	 `set-window-start', as that's less likely to cause surprising
	 scrolling behavior.

2018-04-05  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix dumb mistake in eieio-done-customizing, bump to 0.5.2

	* ebdb-com.el (eieio-done-customizing): Was too hasty with this.

2018-04-05  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix erroneous quoting of option, bump to 0.5.1

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-edit-foo): Shouldn't have been quoting this
	 customization option. Also remove unnecessary let*.
	* ebdb.el: Bump to 0.5.1

2018-04-05  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix debug declaration for ebdb-with-record-edits

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-with-record-edits): Forgot to change this.

2018-04-01  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Bump version to 0.5

2018-04-01  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Update copyright dates

2018-04-01  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Handle mail priority after customization edits

	* ebdb-com.el (eieio-done-customizing): New :after method to set
	 record's mail priorities based on edits to this mail address. Split
	 redisplay out into its own :after method, so it runs after this, as
	well.

2018-04-01  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Use quoted field class

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-record-change-name): Compiler didn't like this.

2018-04-01  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add mail deletion behavior

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-record-delete-field): If deleting a record mail leaves
	 no primary mail address, set the first of the remaining mails as
	 primary.

2018-04-01  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Change behavior of mail insertion

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-record-insert-field): Change what this method does. It
	 previously sorted all the record's mails, which is a no-no because
	 it was setting slot values directly, without going through the
	 database-aware accessors. Don't do that (we still don't have a good
	 way of doing that). Instead, do something else: set the priority the
	 mail, if the record has no other primary mail.

2018-04-01  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add a "follow related" action to role fields

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-field-role): Should be able to hit RET to add the
	 related record.

2018-04-01  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix unnecessary code in ebdb-follow-related

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-follow-related): No need to mapcar ebdb-records,
	 that's what the APPEND argument does.

2018-04-01  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Improvements to ebdb-edit-foo

	* ebdb-com.el (eieio-done-customizing): Use the formatting functions
	 to display field values. Don't offer the primary name for editing.

2018-04-01  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Use values from "slots" in role field ebdb-read

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-read): We should be allowing values in "slots" to
	 override the read process.

2018-04-01  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Move field manipulation "convenience logic" into ebdb-com

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-com-delete-field, ebdb-com-insert-field,
	 ebdb-com-edit-field): Three new generic methods that sit between the
	 high-level interactive commands, and the low-level database editing
	 functions. These methods are the right place for providing
	 field/record-specific behavior.
	* ebdb.el: Remove the equivalent logic from here. This file should be
	 as "dumb" as possible.

2018-04-01  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Set mail priority on record creation

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-read): Make the first mail address entered the
	 priority address.

2018-04-01  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Return results of ebdb-loop-with-exit in correct order

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-loop-with-exit): Items should be in the order the user
	 entered them.

2018-03-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Simplify ebdb-with-record-edits

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-with-record-edits): This macro was trying too
	 hard. Instead of accepting a list of records, just operate on one
	 record at a time. There's some inefficiency -- with multiple
	 records belonging to the same database, there will be a duplicate
	 database check for each record -- but it's not an issue, and this
	 will give us a bit more freedom.
	 (ebdb-insert-field, ebdb-edit-field, ebdb-edit-foo,
	 ebdb-delete-field-or-record, ebdb-delete-records, ebdb-move-records,
	 ebdb-copy-records): Adjust macro calls in these locations.
	* ebdb-test.el (ebdb-test-with-record-edits): Tweak test to match new
	 definition.

2018-03-26  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Organization/role delete method needs to be an :around

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-record-delete-field): Otherwise it hits the existing
	 :around method, which first checks which slot on the organization
	 record can accept the role field, and then raises an error.

2018-03-23  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add experimental ebdb-completion-at-point-function

	* ebdb-complete.el (ebdb-completion-at-point-function): New function
	 that could be used as a completion-at-point function. Not sure this
	 is a good idea, though.

2018-03-22  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Make phone number snarfing regexp less permissive

	* ebdb-snarf.el (ebdb-snarf-routines): This regexp was silly. It was
	 matching tiny little numbers, wreaking havoc on the snarfing
	 process. Also, those little tiny numbers should have raised an error
	 in ebdb-parse for phones.

2018-03-22  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Remove mail-citation-prefix-regexp from strings to snarf

	* ebdb-snarf.el (ebdb-snarf-collect): Work with common case of
	 snarfing mail messages.

2018-03-22  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Mostly re-write ebdb-snarf-collect

	* ebdb-snarf.el (ebdb-snarf-collect): Instead of searching for one
	 likely chunk of field data, and then progressively searching on
	 after that (which could skip field data depending on the order of
	 ebdb-snarf-routines), now find all contiguous field data in a single
	 search, then loop each search routine regexp over that whole block
	 of text. Seems to work a lot better, though there will be a million
	 edge cases to adjust for.

	Addresses #58

2018-03-22  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Adjust snarfing regexp for names

	* ebdb-snarf.el (ebdb-snarf-name-re): The [:space:] class includes
	 newlines, which we don't want. Realistically, this regexp is going
	 to need a whole lot more adjustment to be useful.

2018-03-21  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Improve check for field existence during snarf collapsing

	* ebdb-snarf.el (ebdb-snarf-collapse): Instead of looking for an
	 ebdb-string match for an existing field, use the higher-level
	 `ebdb-record-search'. This should end up being a bit smarter about
	 knowing when a record already has a field.

2018-03-13  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Make it clear what field type we're prompting for

	* ebdb-i18n.el (ebdb-read): In these methods for address and phone
	 fields, the label prompt used to come first, and told the user what
	 kind of field they were adding. Now label prompts come last, and the
	 internationalized methods prompt for country first, and it wasn't
	 clear (especially during record creation) what field type was being
	 prompted for. Clarify that here.

2018-03-11  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add a basic language field

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-field-language): New field. Has no particular behavior
	 yet. Could possibly be used to switch input methods.

2018-03-11  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Use Gnus' window configuration for popping up EBDB buffers

	* ebdb-gnus.el (ebdb-gnus-window-configuration): New customization
	 option for changing how the *EBDB-Gnus* buffer is displayed.
	 Something still isn't working correctly here, though -- while the
	 Gnus article buffers are now wrapped correctly, the EBDB buffer
	 still isn't wrapped right.

	Relevant to #62

2018-03-11  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Make gnus-message window config stuff customizable

	* ebdb-message.el (ebdb-message-reply-window-config,
	 ebdb-message-reply-yank-window-config): New customization options,
	 replacing the earlier hard-coded window configs.

2018-03-11  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Pop up EBDB windows before formatting records

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-display-records): In most cases, this ought to
	 allow filling of record values to work correctly, because
	 `window-text-width' will return a reasonable value. This still isn't
	 working for Gnus, possibly because of how Gnus' window configuration
	 works.

	Partially addresses #62

2018-03-11  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	ebdb-mua defgroup in wrong file

	For some reason it was in ebdb-gnus.el. Move to ebdb-mua.el.

2018-03-11  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Change interactive behavior of ebdb-mail-aliases

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-mail-aliases): Remove optional "noisy" argument,
	 nothing was using it. Instead use `called-interactively-p' to decide
	 whether to add a message.

2018-02-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Forgot to pop-to-buffer to after creating citation buffer

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-cite-records-ebdb): Not much use if you can't see
	 it.

2018-02-26  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Don't append citation to kill ring in ebdb-cite-records-ebdb

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-cite-records-ebdb): If I'd gone to the trouble of
	 setting up the temp buffer, why would I then stick the citations on
	 the kill ring?

2018-02-24  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix font inheritance of mail addresses

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-mail-defunct, ebdb-mail-primary): Had the
	 inheritance order reversed.

2018-02-18  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Bump EBDB version to 0.4.3

2018-02-18  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Absorb helm-ebdb package, rename to ebdb-helm

	* ebdb-helm.el: Don't requre helm, only declare-function.

2018-02-18  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Re-work ebdb-records-cite

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-records-cite): I was trying to be too clever combining
	 :around methods with &context specializers, and generally tripping
	 over my own feet. This version has more duplicate code, but behaves
	 correctly.

2017-12-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	New option ebdb-print-object-name

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-print-object-name): Local equivalent to
	 eieio-print-object-name.
	 (ebdb-db-save): Set eieio variable based on this option.

2017-12-09  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Make explicit "full" formatter

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-full-formatter): New defconst holding the
	 formatter used for displaying all a record's fields, even internal
	 fields.
	 (ebdb-display-records-completely): Use this new formatter. The old
	 "clone" trick added a new spurious formatter to the formatter
	 tracker every time it was called.

2017-11-25  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Docstring changes

	Inspired by checkdoc.

2017-11-25  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix mail sorting

	* ebdb.el: This was supposed to be an :after method, on
	 ebdb-record-insert-field, not a :before.

2017-11-25  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Get rid of ebdb-version

	* ebdb.el: Removing ebdb-version (function and variable) and
	 ebdb-version-date. Sort of pointless with a package.

2017-11-23  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Manipulation of ebdb-db-list *still* in the wrong place

	Despite d88895

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-load): If a user were adding a database object
	 directly to the list, it would not have gotten added to
	 ebdb-db-list.

2017-11-15  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	New ebdb-fmt-field for the oneline style in EBDB buffers

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-fmt-field): Add an ellipsis, and a tooltip.

2017-11-14  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	New option ebdb-vacuum-databases

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-vacuum-databases): In newer Emacs, allows removing
	 indentation from database files.
	 (ebdb-db-save): Consult and set eieio-print-indentation
	 appropriately.

2017-11-09  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Remove mysterious "3"

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-pop-up-window): I'm blaming company-mode.

2017-11-09  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Use derived-mode-p

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-redisplay-records): Instead of checking
	 major-mode.

2017-11-09  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add support for atomic windows

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-join-atomic-windows): New option governing atomic
	 window behavior.
	 (ebdb-pop-up-window): Check if we're popping-up from an atomic
	 window, and maybe join it.

2017-11-04  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Prompt for label after other field values

	Fixes #61

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-read): The ebdb-field-labeled method is still an
	 :around method, but the work is now done after the field itself is
	 read. There were two issues: one, entering an empty string for the
	label
	 prompted to create the empty string as a label -- nonsensical. Two,
	 the label was required: if the user canceled label input, the whole
	 field creation process was cancelled. Now we allow null labels.
	(ebdb-read-string): Use string-empty-p.
	* ebdb.org: Tweak docs accordingly.

2017-11-01  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix ebdb-load and manipulation of ebdb-db-list, bump version

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-load): Strange no one hit this, everyone must be
	 migrating. Bump to 0.4.2.

2017-10-30  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix ebdb-ispell-export, bump version

	* ebdb-ispell.el (ebdb-ispell-export): More stupid mistakes.

2017-10-27  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	More complete version of migration from Org contacts, version 0.4

	Fixes #56

	* ebdb-migrate.el (ebdb-migrate-from-org-contacts): Do a better job
	 catching and reporting errors, mostly.
	 (ebdb-migrate-from-bbdb): Make this one interactive, as well.
	* ebdb.org: Document.
	* ebdb.el: Bump version to 0.4

2017-10-27  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	New ebdb-shutdown command

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-shutdown): Saves, closes everything, and clears
	 variables. Probably mostly useful to myself.

2017-10-22  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Adjust initialize-instance for records

	* ebdb.el (initialize-instance): Fix the insurance regarding timestamp
	 and creation-date fields. Should be addressing the "slots" argument,
	 not the record's slots.
	* ebdb-test.el (ebdb-auto-insert-timestamp-creation): Test all this.

2017-10-22  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Protect against bug with timestamp/creation-dates

	The real solution will involve fixing initialize-instance for records so
	that the timestamp/creation-date are installed no matter what.

	* ebdb-format.el (ebdb-fmt-collect-fields): Stop-gap protection
	 against missing creation-date and timestamp fields.
	* ebdb.el: Bump to 0.3.5

2017-10-21  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	New defsubst ebdb-record-self

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-record-self): Convenience subst for returning the self
	 record.
	 (ebdb-field-phone-signal-text): Use it.
	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-get-user-mail-address-re): Use it.
	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-signal-text): Use it.

2017-10-21  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Use cached record name string in cl-print-object

	* ebdb.el (cl-print-object): Don't recalculate.

2017-10-21  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Compiler-inspired fixes, vol 335534

	Where "compiler" is understood to mean "Stefan"

	* ebdb-migrate.el (ebdb-migrate-from-bbdb,
	 ebdb-migrate-vector-to-class): Get rid of remaining usages of oset.
	* ebdb-mu4e.el: Declare functions from message.el
	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-delete-field): Note unused argument.
	* ebdb-pgp.el: Declare function from ebdb-mua.
	* ebdb.el (ebdb-sources): Change default and type of ebdb-sources.

2017-10-21  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	New ebdb-record-change-name methods for strings

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-record-change-name): One for people and organizations.
	 I think I was failing this before because I was trying to call
	 cl-call-next-method, when I should have been restarting the method
	 call altogether.
	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-annotate-message): Now we don't need to know the
	 record class.

2017-10-21  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	New MUA command for toggling record layout

	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-mua-toggle-records-format): New command to toggle
	 layout from MUA windows.
	 (ebdb-mua-keymap): Bind to "; t".
	* ebdb.org: Document.

2017-10-21  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add optional "shortcut" arg to ebdb-prompt-for-db

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-prompt-for-db): If non-nil and there's only one
	 database, just return it without prompting.
	* ebdb-migrate.el (ebdb-migrate-from-bbdb): Adjust call.
	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-create-record-extended): Adjust call.

2017-10-21  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add ebdb-org-field-tags to ebdb-hash-extra-predicates

	* ebdb-org.el: Use the fast lookups for this field, too.

2017-10-21  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Downcase all-completions string when searching

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-search): ebdb-puthash downcases its strings, so
	 downcase the strings when doing all-completions, too. Actually,
	 maybe we shouldn't be downcasing strings on hash -- is that leftover
	 from when the hashtable was actually an obarray?

2017-10-21  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Get ebdb-ispell working again

	* ebdb-ispell.el (ebdb-ispell-dictionary-list): Remove variable. Maybe
	 I'm misunderstanding how this worked, but why were we looping over
	 _other_ dictionaries? The previous version as written also errored
	 out, unable to find the personal dictionary. Simplify the whole
	 thing: just check the word, and add it if it's "misspelled".
	 (ebdb-ispell-field-list): Remove variable. Just loop all the names.
	 (ebdb-ispell-word-list): Remove variable. Have the function
	 return the word list instead of setting this variable.
	 (ebdb-ispell-export): Simplify function.

2017-10-21  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Part one of migration from org-contacts

	* ebdb-migrate.el (ebdb-migrate-org-simple-correspondences): Variable
	 holding correspondences between org-contacts property names and EBDB
	 field types.
	 (ebdb-migrate-from-org-contacts): Do the migration. Fails to migrate
	 addresses at present; this needs to be addressed.
	* ebdb-migrate.el (ebdb-migrate-from-bbdb): Change messages to specify
	 BBDB.

2017-10-18  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add browse-url action for domain fields

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-field-domain): Add action.
	 (ebdb-field-domain-browse): New method for browsing the domain as a
	 URL.

2017-10-18  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix function call

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-load): Forgot the eieio prefix to `eieio-object-p'.

2017-10-18  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Give formatters a post-format-function slot

	* ebdb-format.el (ebdb-formatter): Essentially a post-format hook,
	 intended to be used to set a major mode.
	 (ebdb-format-to-tmp-buffer): Call it.
	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-formatter-ebdb): Set it to #'text-mode for the
	 ebdb formatter -- it isn't used during normal *EBDB* buffer
	 formatting.

2017-10-18  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Turns out ebdb-fmt-collect-fields could have been a lot simpler

	* ebdb-format.el (ebdb-fmt-collect-fields): All these methods were
	 basically duplicating the work of `ebdb-record-current-fields', so
	 just use that instead, and filter according to the formatter.

2017-10-16  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Bah, commited a bit of (erroneous) test code

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-mail-default): That's not even how you do it.

2017-10-16  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Provide more control over faces in *EBDB* buffers

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-phone-default, ebdb-address-default,
	 ebdb-mail-default): Provide default faces for the three main field
	 types. Other mail faces inherit from ebdb-mail-default.
	 (ebdb-fmt-field): Provide a few methods that apply the appropriate
	 face.

2017-10-14  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix parsing of address countries during migration

	* ebdb-migrate.el (ebdb-migrate-vector-to-class): What I meant to do
	 was match countries to symbols via ebdb-i18n-countries. I was doing
	 it wrong, but shouldn't have been doing it at all.

2017-10-14  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Various tweaks

	Suggested by Stefan

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-pop-up-window): Use pop-to-buffer-same-window.
	* ebdb-gnus.el (ebdb/gnus-score): Docs.
	* ebdb-migrate.el (ebdb-migrate-from-bbdb): Use
	 condition-case-unless-debug, also docs.
	* ebdb.el (cl-print-object): Make sure 'file slot is bound.
	 (ebdb-load): mapc -- side effect only.

2017-10-14  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Adjust database checks when loading

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-load): Checks were previously both incomplete and
	 redundant. By the time the first loop over ebdb-sources is complete,
	 we should be completely confident that the database is of the
	 correct class.

2017-10-08  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Bump to version 0.3.4

2017-10-08  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	More autoloads and defvars for ebdb-wl

	* ebdb-wl.el: Didn't check after the last update.

2017-10-08  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Don't use either variant of when-let and if-let

	Fixes #54

	* ebdb.el:
	* ebdb-wl.el:
	* ebdb-vcard.el:
	* ebdb-snarf.el:
	* ebdb-pgp.el:
	* ebdb-mua.el: The unstarred variants cause obsolesence warnings, the
	 starred versions only exist in Emacs 26.

2017-10-08  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Refine passport field string output

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-string): The ebdb-string method should also output
	 issue and expiration dates.
	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-fmt-field): The ebdb-fmt-field method can just do
	 country and number.

2017-10-05  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	More complete support for Wanderlust MUA

	* ebdb-wl.el (ebdb-mua-prepare-article, ebdb-mua-article-body,
	 ebdb-mua-article-signature): Implement these methods.
	 (ebdb-wl-quit-window): New function added to `wl-summary-exit-hook',
	 for quitting the EBDB buffer when returning to the folder buffer.
	* ebdb.org
	* ebdb.texi
	* ebdb.info: Mention support in docs.

2017-10-01  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add support for Wanderlust MUA

	* ebdb-wl.el: Does everything it's supposed to (in a Works on My
	 Machine kind of way), except for retrieving message body and
	 signature for snarfing.

2017-09-26  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Bump version to 0.3.3

2017-09-25  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Use ebdb-i18n-countries defsubst in i18n address reading

	* ebdb-i18n.el (ebdb-read): This was a bug, there was no "countries"
	 variable at all.

2017-09-25  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Change ebdb-vcard to use generic ebdb-field-tags

	* ebdb-vcard.el: Don't reference ebdb-org-field-tags, that's not
	 loaded. It should work the same, though.

2017-09-25  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix to dumb mistakes in 8fc7b6d69, fast lookups

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-search): This is what the tests are for...

2017-09-25  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Revert "Use value of ebdb-mua-folder-list in VM splitting"

	This reverts commit 823a7d428f829f6f965540d530fb86e579705555.

	Why does this file keep coming back from the dead?

2017-09-25  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix all when-let and if-let to use starred versions

	* ebdb-mua.el
	* ebdb-pgp.el
	* ebdb-snarf.el
	* ebdb-vcard.el
	* ebdb.el: Fix all uses.

2017-09-25  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add formatting for Russian phone numbers

	* ebdb-i18n-basic.el (ebdb-string-i18n): Why not?

2017-09-25  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Provide an ebdb-parse method for addresses

	* ebdb-i18n.el (ebdb-parse): This is a base ebdb-parse method, but
	 lives here because address parsing is only supported for
	 internationalized EBDB.
	* ebdb-i18n-basic.el (ebdb-parse-i18n): Provide a base parsing method
	 for US addresses.

2017-09-25  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Start collecting random internationalized methods

	* ebdb-i18n-basic.el: New file, where I'll put everything that occurs
	 to me. If and as country-specific libraries are developed, the
	 relevant methods can be removed from this file.
	* ebdb-i18n.el: Require the above file.

2017-09-25  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Simplify address formatting

	The idea is to make the basic address formatting function very simple. 
	For all other requirements, users should be loading ebdb-i18n.

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-default-address-format-function): New option
	 specifying a basic formatting function to use for all addresses.
	 (ebdb-string): Call that function from the ebdb-string method for
	 addresses.

	Deleted the ebdb-address-format-list option, and the ebdb-format-address
	function.

2017-09-25  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Quietly swap order of arguments to ebdb-read-i18n for addresses

	* ebdb-i18n.el (ebdb-read): Nothing was actually using this, so why
	 not. Need to have the country spec come before the optional
	 arguments.

2017-09-25  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Drop postcode guards

	* ebdb.el: This was a lot of code just to prevent people from writing
	 invalid postcodes. And so what if they did? Deleting:
	 ebdb-continental-postcode-regexp, ebdb-check-postcode,
	 ebdb-parse-postcode, and ebdb-address-continental-p.
	 (ebdb-read): Don't check postcode.

2017-09-25  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Finish ebdb-internationalize-addresses

	* ebdb-i18n.el (ebdb-internationalize-addresses): This function wasn't
	 actually written before.

2017-09-25  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	New defsubst ebdb-i18n-countries

	* ebdb-i18n.el (ebdb-i18n-countries): Just appends the two alists
	 ebdb-i18n-countries-pref-scripts and ebdb-i18n-countries.
	 (ebdb-internationalize-addresses): Use.
	 (ebdb-read): Use.
	* ebdb.el (ebdb-format-address): Use.

2017-09-25  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Set up EBDB buffers to offer save on save-some-buffers

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-mode): As of around now, `save-some-buffers' will
	 accept for an `always' value for `buffer-offer-save'.

2017-09-19  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix slot customize declaration for bank account field

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-field-bank-account): Both 'routing-aba and 'swift-bic
	 needed to handle the null possibility in the :custom declaration.

2017-09-19  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Change name of automatic save option

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-save-on-exit): Change from `ebdb-install-save-hook'.
	 Use a name that says what it does, not how it does it.. This is a
	 very new option, hopefully no one will notice the rename.
	* ebdb.org: Change docs.
	* ebdb.info: etc
	* ebdb.texi: etc

2017-09-17  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Bump version for 0.3.2

	* ebdb.el: Bump.
	* ebdb.org: Note present version and date in subtitle.
	* ebdb.texi: Export.
	* ebdb.info: Oddly, the subtitle doesn't seem to make it to the
	 exported Info manual itself.

2017-09-17  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	More complete error handling for field insertion

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-insert-field): We were only catching the
	 'ebdb-unacceptable-field error; other errors were being silently
	 swallowed.

2017-09-17  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix up ebdb-string method for bank accounts

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-string): Protect against non-existent bank address,
	 swap newlines around, and use ebdb-string on the notes field --
	 previously this was outputting the string representation of the
	 object itself.

2017-09-17  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Check type spec of slots that may or may not accept an object

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-field-bank-account): A type spec that looks like `(or
	 null class-name)' *must* specify the null first, then the class
	 name. Putting the class name first results in an error. This seems
	 like a bug to me -- it's an `or' statement, it shouldn't matter.

2017-09-14  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Apparently when-let will be obsoleted by when-let*

	* ebdb-snarf.el (ebdb-snarf-query): Okay, then.

2017-09-12  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Try different faces in EBDB buffers

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-organization-name): Green is less alarming.
	 (ebdb-defunct): Defunct is better as a light gray?

2017-09-12  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add ebdb-save to write-contents-functions in EBDB buffers

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-mode): As of Emacs 6db8491 this will be sufficient
	 to offer *EBDB* buffers for saving when running save-some-buffers.
	 Theoretically, we can also bind "s" to save-buffer now.

2017-09-10  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	New option ebdb-try-speedups

	Addresses #53

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-try-speedups): Do "risky things" in an effort to make
	 EBDB go faster. Right now all that means is setting
	 eieio-skip-typecheck to t while loading, but other tricks could be
	 governed by this option in the future.
	* ebdb.org: Document.
	* ebdb.texi: etc
	* ebdb.info: etc

2017-09-10  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Part two of threaded version of ebdb-initialize

	Related to #53

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-load): I forgot to make the thread. Still not
	 convinced anything can actually be done with this, but it shouldn't
	 hurt.

2017-09-09  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Provide an alternate threaded version of ebdb-initialize

	Ref #53

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-initialize): New function that calls thread-yield
	 every 10 records. This won't do anything at all by default.
	 (ebdb-load): Use the function if threading is available.

2017-09-09  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Give some indication that the migration process is ongoing

	Fixes #51

	* ebdb-migrate.el (ebdb-migrate-from-bbdb): Report as records are
	 migrated. Why does it take so damn long?

2017-09-09  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add a dir file for the Info manual

	Fixes #49

	* dir: So the manual is picked up automatically.

2017-09-09  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Provide better instructions for BBDB migration

	Fixes #50

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-load): Also check for the presence of a BBDB file,
	 even if bbdb-file isn't set.
	* ebdb-migrate.el (ebdb-migrate-from-bbdb): Do the same here.
	* ebdb.org: Mention in manual that you should set bbdb-file to
	 migrate.

2017-09-07  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Allow "fast lookups"

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-search): Allow for two kinds of searches, the regular
	 brute force loop, and a hashtable lookup.
	 (ebdb-hash-p): Allow more predicate symbols.
	* ebdb.org: Document.

2017-09-06  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Allow two kinds of searches on tags

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-search-read): If there's a [-+|&] in the search
	 string, use an org tag matcher, otherwise it's just a single tag,
	 return that tag.

2017-09-06  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Hash records against their tag field tags

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-init-field, ebdb-delete-field): The idea is that tags
	 should be usable for quick hashtable lookups.

2017-09-06  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Comment out some custom definitions for address field

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-field-bank-account): Apparently the customization
	 interface can't handle having other eieio objects inserted as slot
	 customization types. Or else I haven't figured out how to do it
	 correctly.

2017-09-06  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add ebdb-field-bank-account class

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-field-bank-account): New class holding bank account
	information.
	 (ebdb-read, ebdb-string): Basic methods, no ebdb-parse.
	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-fmt-field): Special output for this class.

2017-09-06  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add defgeneric for ebdb-read

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-read): Want the function signature.

2017-09-05  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Don't unilaterally add to kill-emacs-hook

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-install-save-hook): New option allowing users to
	 specify whether to add ebdb-save to the kill-emacs-hook. Defaults to t.
	 (ebdb-load): Check and act on option here.
	* ebdb-com.el: Do not add hook at top-level here.
	* ebdb.org: Note in manual.
	* ebdb.info: etc
	* ebdb.texi: etc

2017-09-04  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Change behavior of ebdb-fmt-compose-field

	* ebdb-format.el (ebdb-fmt-compose-field): This function should not
	 mapconcat the field-instance strings, that should be up to the
	 formatter.
	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-fmt-record-header, ebdb-fmt-record-body): Handle
	 the new return value.

2017-09-03  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Upgrade instances of old gnus splitting fields

	* ebdb-gnus.el: Re-instate stubs for ebdb-gnus-private-field and
	 ebdb-gnus-imap field, and override their make-instance methods to
	 return instances of ebdb-field-mail-folder instead.
	* ebdb.el: Bump version.

2017-09-03  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Merge remote-tracking branch 'elpa/externals/ebdb'

2017-09-03  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Bump version to 0.3

2017-09-03  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Make mail alias updating happen automatically

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-mode): Add it to the mode function.
	* ebdb.org: Note the change in the manual.

2017-09-03  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Alter migration process to convert various folder fields

	* ebdb-migrate.el (bbdb/vm-auto-folder-field): Preserve this custom
	 option here.
	 (ebdb-migrate-vector-to-class): Catch instances of old
	 splitting-related fields, and turn them all into instances of
	 `ebdb-field-mail-folder'.

2017-09-03  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Use value of ebdb-mua-folder-list in VM splitting

	* ebdb-vm.el (ebdb/vm-auto-folder): Change function body to use the
	 list.
	 (ebdb/vm-auto-folder-field): This defcustom no longer exists (it has
	 been preserved in the migration process, however).

2017-09-03  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Use value of ebdb-mail-folder-list in Gnus splitting

	* ebdb-gnus.el (ebdb/gnus-split-folders-list): This function now just
	 consults ebdb-mail-folder-list.

2017-09-03  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add new ebdb-field-mail-folder fieldclass

	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-mail-folder-list): New variable holding
	 correspondences between folder names and mail regexps.
	 (ebdb-field-mail-folder): New class holding a mail folder name to
	 split to. Also all the basic field methods.

2017-09-03  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Remove texinfo manual dependency on texinfo+

	* ebdb.org: The Org-format manual now only uses native ox-texinfo
	 processing. Also made quite a few refinements to the manual.
	* ebdb.info: etc
	* ebdb.texi: etc

2017-09-01  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Use simpler home-grown version of char-fold-to-regexp

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-char-fold-table): Char table holding simplified
	 correspondences between characters and their decomposition.
	 (ebdb-char-fold-to-regexp): New function for creating a regexp that
	 only targets alphabetic characters, while leaving regexp-special
	 characters alone.

2017-08-31  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix to internationalized ebdb-read for phones

	* ebdb-i18n.el (ebdb-read): Need to pick up the existing area code.
	* ebdb.el (ebdb-read): But really, why aren't we letting them edit the
	 area code?

2017-08-31  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Protect against searching labeled fields with no label

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-field-search): Make sure it's a string.

2017-08-30  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix compiler warnings

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-edit-field-customize): This was actually a stupid
	 bug.
	* ebdb-migrate.el:
	* ebdb.el (ebdb-record-insert-field): defvars, declare-functions, etc.

2017-08-30  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Provide ebdb-load guard in mua-auto-update

	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-mua-auto-update): It's possible that we'll reach
	 this point before any other EBDB load-triggering code has been
	 reached. The call to ebdb-get-address-components then leads to
	 ebdb-get-user-mail-address-re, which can fail if
	 ebdb-user-mail-address-re is set to 'self but records aren't loaded.

2017-08-30  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add to ebdb-db-list in ebdb-test-with-database

	* ebdb-test.el (ebdb-test-with-database): This used to happen as a
	 part of ebdb-db-load, now it happens in ebdb-load. We can't call
	 that function in testing, so do the ebdb-db-list manipulation here.
	 All checks in the codebase look to see if that variable is nil
	 before running ebdb-load, so it must be populated.

2017-08-30  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Don't hide cl-print-object definitions

	* ebdb.el: There's no need to hide it behind fboundp. If a user's
	 Emacs doesn't define it, no harm done: we'll define it, and it just
	 won't get used. We could even use it ourselves, this way.

2017-08-30  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Stop pretending we don't depend on calendar.el

	* ebdb.el: Calendar is built in, just require it.

2017-08-30  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Have ebdb-do-records filter out stub uuids

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-do-records): Only operate on the record if it's a
	 proper record.

	All this is sort of moving towards making the unloading of databases 
	completely bulletproof.

2017-08-30  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add generic tags field

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-field-tags): New class. Previously there was only the
	 org-tags field in ebdb-org; now this generic class provides much of
	 the same behavior, and the org-specific class is a subclass.
	 (ebdb-string, ebdb-init-field): Basic methods, moved over from
	 ebdb-org.
	 (ebdb-tags): Variable holding tags used in the EBDB, moved over and
	 renamed from ebdb-org-tags.
	 (ebdb-search-read, ebdb-field-search): Use the Org function
	 org-make-tags-matcher to prompt for tag search criteria and match
	 that against records. Free code! Also a search method with string
	 specializer. The function specializer is broken?
	* ebdb-org.el (ebdb-org-field-tags): This field now inherits from
	 ebdb-field-tags.
	 (ebdb-org-agenda-popup): Command for popping up an EBDB buffer from
	 an Org Agenda tags-match buffer, containing records matching the Org
	 tags search.
	 (ebdb-read): This is really the only method that makes the
	 org-specific class any different.
	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-search-tags): Provide and bind a specific search
	 command for searching on tags, for convenience.

2017-08-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add gender field class

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-field-gender): New field class, inheriting from
	 ebdb-field-singleton.
	(ebdb-read, ebdb-string): Base methods.

2017-08-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add ebdb-field-singleton abstract field class

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-field-singleton): Records can only hold one instance
	 of any field subclassing this class.
	 (ebdb-record-insert-field): Check for existing same-class instance,
	 and delete it if present.

2017-08-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Refine database disabling/re-enabling

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-load): If a database has been disabled, it is still
	 read next time EBDB is loaded. In the case of ebdb-db-file, that
	 means the databases records have been directly loaded and added to
	 ebdb-record-tracker, which will wreak havoc. Delete the db's records
	 after loading. Also, add the db to ebdb-db-list here, because it
	 needs to be in the list so that users can edit it to re-enable it.
	 (ebdb-db-load): Don't add to the list in the :after method anymore.
	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-redisplay-records): After a database is re-enabled
	 and re-loaded, its records will first be un-displayed with this
	 function. Since the records aren't hashed yet, that will cause an
	 error. If a record is given as a uuid, but it can't be looked up in
	 the hash table, simply discard the uuid.

2017-08-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix custom type for database buffer-char slot

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-db): Could be character or nil.

2017-08-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Provide more careful control of finding related records

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-related-unfound): New error.
	 (ebdb-record-related): Raise the new error in this method, if no
	 related record is found. Also, raise it in the base method.
	 (ebdb-init-field, ebdb-delete-field, ebdb-string): Use method and
	 error in these methods for role fields.
	 (ebdb-record-related): Raise the error in all implementations of
	 this method.
	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-fmt-field): We can now collapse formatting of
	 roles-on-people and roles-on-organizations into one method.
	 (ebdb-follow-related): Handle error here.
	* ebdb-test.el (ebdb-test-with-records): Also shadow the
	 ebdb-org-hashtable variable, even though we didn't end up using it
	 here.
	 (ebdb-cant-find-related-role): New sanity test for raising the
	 error.
	 (ebdb-unload-db-with-relations): New test for breaking cross-db
	 relations.

2017-08-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix to database disabling

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-db-disable): Previously this was a catch-22 -- setting
	 the disabled slot to t meant that ebdb-db-save would always error.
	 Use the new "force" argument to ebdb-db-save to prevent that
	 happening.

2017-08-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Base ebdb-db-save method should be on ebdb-db class

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-db-save): This shouldn't be specialized for
	 ebdb-db-file -- all db classes will use this behavior.

2017-08-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add "force" argument to ebdb-db-save

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-db-save): Make a defgeneric; add a force argument.
	 When non-nil, the save call will go through regardless of errors
	 raised, and regardless of whether the database or its records are
	 "dirty".

2017-08-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Revert "Make ebdb-hashtable weak on value"

	Fixes #48

	This reverts commit 999374cfeeef41ffa4d8ac34aee21e5f9166efa1. Clearly I
	had no idea what this actually did.

2017-08-18  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Re-remove ebdb-vm

	* ebdb-vm.el: Version mismatch may be resolved in the future, may not.
	 For now, the file has gone in its own branch.

2017-08-18  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	People have hyphens and apostrophes in their surnames

	* ebdb-snarf.el (ebdb-snarf-name-re): In fact this whole approach is
	 probably going to get thrown out eventually, but might as well make
	 it a little better.

2017-08-16  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix mis-named variable

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-records-cite): Dumb.

2017-08-16  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Make ebdb-hashtable weak on value

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-hashtable): I haven't run into bugs on this (and
	 ideally won't), but better safe than sorry.

2017-08-15  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* ebdb: Fix a few compilation warnings

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-record-insert-field, ebdb-record-delete-field): Can't
	dispatch on optional args.
	(ebdb-i18n-countries-pref-scripts): Declare.
	(ebdb-records-cite): Fix typo.

	* .gitignore: Ignore files generated when installed and edited in place.

2017-08-15  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Use insert/delete methods with edit-field-customize

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-edit-field-customize, eieio-done-customizing):
	 These methods need to run ebdb-record-delete-field and
	 ebdb-record-insert-field, same as regular editing.

2017-08-15  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Work on getting ebdb-vm.el back into place

	* ebdb-vm.el: Restore file. Fun with declare-function and defvar in
	 order to keep the compiler quiet if vm isn't installed. This library
	 still isn't usable, as the EBDB part of it still relies on functions
	 that no longer exist, eg the xfield stuff.

2017-08-15  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Swap sense of insert/kill arg to ebdb-cite-records

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-cite-records): This led to backwards behavior when
	 called from ebdb-cite-records-ebdb.
	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-cite-records-ebdb): Pass arg.

2017-08-15  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Re-instate ebdb-mu4e.el

	* ebdb-mu4e.el: With changes suggested by Stefan Monnier, to prevent
	 compiler errors when mu4e is not present on the system.

2017-08-14  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Yank ebdb-mu4e.el and ebdb-vm.el

	Delete both files for now. Those libraries are not available by default,
	and will cause compilation errors. Think of some other solution.

2017-08-14  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Don't use eieio-oset-default

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-db, ebdb-field-image): Turns out I was told this for a
	 reason.
	* ebdb-format.el (ebdb-formatter): Here too.

2017-08-13  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Move the mail field sorting thing to a :before method

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-record-insert-field): Having it run :after meant the
	 change wasn't actually written to the database. A :before method
	 seems to work fine.

2017-08-13  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix up record citation, bind a command in EBDB mode

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-cite-records-ebdb): New interactive command in
	 ebdb-mode for copying record citations to the kill ring.
	 (ebdb-mode-map): Bind.
	* ebdb.el (ebdb-cite-records): Accept a new INSERT argument, saying
	 whether to insert the citation ring, or copy it to the kill ring.
	 (ebdb-records-cite): Fix most of the methods. Can't use text-mode,
	 since both html-mode and org-mode derive from that.
	* ebdb.org: Document command.
	* ebdb.texi: etc
	* ebdb.info: etc

2017-08-13  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Wrong slot names when reading addresses

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-read): That's what you get for copy and pasting.

2017-08-13  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add internationalized version of ebdb-string for addresses

	* ebdb-i18n.el (ebdb-string): This is important to have.

	There's also an internationalized version of ebdb-parse for addresses in
	there, but since there's no *non-internationalized* version of 
	ebdb-parse for addresses, it's commented out for now.

2017-08-13  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix bug in searching by database

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-record-search): That's not how you use `member'.

2017-08-13  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Use autoload cookies on defclass statements

	* ebdb.el: There was no reason to be calling `eieio-defclass-autoload'
	 myself.
	* ebdb-gnus.el: add cookie
	* ebdb-org.el: etc
	* ebdb-pgp.el: etc

2017-08-13  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Remove Brian Edmonds' code until copyright resolved

	* ebdb-gnus.el: The Gnus split stuff. Hopefully a temporary removal.

2017-08-13  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	New option ebdb-i18n-countries-pref-scripts

	* ebdb-i18n.el (ebdb-i18n-countries-pref-scripts): New option, an
	 alist that mirrors ebdb-i18n-countries, with country names in an
	 alternate/preferred script. Meant to allow selection/display of
	 country names in their native script.
	 (ebdb-read): Use both variables for completing read.
	* ebdb.el (ebdb-format-address-default): Use both variables for
	 display.
	 (ebdb-format-address): Use both variables for display.
	* ebdb.org: Mention in manual.

2017-08-13  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add some country name "shorthands"

	* ebdb-i18n.el (ebdb-i18n-countries): Country names were previously
	 fully written out, leading to some silly address displays. Add
	 elements to this alist permitting selection by country
	 abbreviations. Abbreviated elements come before the fully-written
	 elements, meaning that, while completing-read will accept either
	 string, display will use the abbreviated string.

2017-08-13  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Changes to manual and README, reflecting EBDB's move to ELPA

	* README.org: This was sort of acting as a manual, before we had one.
	* ebdb.org: Mention which packages are now separately loadable.
	* ebdb.info: etc
	* ebdb.texi: etc

2017-08-13  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Remove libraries that will live in separate packages

	Remove company-ebdb, counsel-ebdb, ebdb-chn, ebdb-gnorb, and helm-ebdb.
	They will be installable separately from ELPA.

	* ebdb-migrate.el (ebdb-migrate-from-bbdb): Move require statement for
	 ebdb-gnorb, it won't be available by default.

2017-08-11  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Prepare ebdb-gnorb to be extricated

	Though who knows where it should actually go.

	* ebdb.el: Remove the defclass autoload for gnorb-ebdb-field-messages
	 from this file.
	* ebdb-gnorb.el: Put it here, where it should (?) be correctly picked
	 up by Elpa's autoload creation routines. Also, add correct library
	 headers, and require bits of Gnorb.

2017-08-11  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Compiler-inspired fixes version 443992

	Getting as close to zero warnings as possible before going into ELPA

	Mostly moving code around so it's defined in the right order, more 
	defvars, declare-functions and autoloads, underscores on unused 
	parameters, some deletion of unused/unreachable code. And I snuck in 
	some edits to phone dialing (sorry!).

2017-08-11  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Catching wrong error in internationalized version of name string

	* ebdb-i18n.el (ebdb-string): Catch the cl-no-method parent error.
	 Noticed this for the other methods, missed it here.

2017-08-11  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Replace trailing whitespace in tests

	* ebdb-test.el (ebdb-vcard-escape/unescape): That was supposed to be
	 there! Need to remove `delete-trailing-whitespace' from
	 `before-save-hook', for this file only.

2017-08-11  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Don't require ebdb-chn from ebdb-i18n

	* ebdb-i18n.el: ebdb-chn is going into a separate package.
	* ebdb-chn.el: Instead, require ebdb-i8n from here.
	* ebdb-i18n-test.el: Remove dependency on ebdb-chn, and the test that
	 tested it. Where else can we put that?

2017-08-10  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Rename ebdb-message-header to ebdb-mua-message-header

	Best to get some naming consistency now, before anyone really uses this.

2017-08-10  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add new manual section about writing MUA integration

	* ebdb.org (Writing Integration For New MUAs): New section.
	* ebdb.texi: etc
	* ebdb.info: etc

2017-08-10  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Move "Writing Internationalization Libraries" in manual

	* ebdb.org (Writing Internationalization Libraries): Move it to the
	 hacking section.
	* ebdb.info: etc
	* ebdb.texi: etc

2017-08-10  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add phone field snarfing to the list of snarf routines

	* ebdb-snarf.el (ebdb-snarf-routines): This regexp will likely need
	 tuning.

	Actually, it's becoming obvious that these regexps need to be kept 
	somewhere else.

2017-08-10  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Refactor snarfing

	* ebdb-snarf.el (ebdb-snarf): Don't set up the temp buffer here. Also,
	 add additional argument determining whether to display or return the
	 records found.
	 (ebdb-snarf-collect): Do the temp buffer setup here.
	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-mua-snarf-article): Use new calling convention of
	 ebdb-snarf to return and combine snarfed records from both the
	 article body and the signature. (ebdb-mua-article-body,
	 ebdb-mua-article-signature): The default return value of these two
	 methods should be nil, not an empty string, that's unneccesarily
	 complicated.
	* ebdb-test.el (ebdb-snarf-mail-and-name): Alter test accordingly.

2017-08-08  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Bug in 851c0f1, signature snarfing

	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-mua-snarf-article): Changed the method name and
	 neglected to change it here, too.

2017-08-08  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Internationalized ebdb-parse for phones wasn't doing enough setup

	* ebdb-i18n.el (ebdb-parse): This method needs to remove the country
	 code from the string, and set it in the slots. I hadn't run into
	 this before because the read method works correctly, and there's
	 nowhere in the code where the internationalized parser is given a
	 raw phone string. Adding phones to the snarfing routines revealed
	 the bug.

2017-08-07  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	File header changes preparatory to breaking off separate libraries

	* company-ebdb.el:
	* counsel-ebdb.el:
	* helm-ebdb.el: These three completion libraries will become separate
	 single-file packages.
	* ebdb-chn.el: This country-specific library will become a separate
	 package, and be renamed to ebdb-i18n-chn.el, which will be the
	 naming convention for future internationalization libraries.
	* ebdb.el: Include Emacs version number dependency.

2017-08-06  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Prefix arg to article snarfing only snarfs signature

	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-mua-snarf-article): Accept a prefix arg. If
	 present, only snarf the signature, not the article body.
	* ebdb.org: Mention in manual.
	* ebdb.texi: etc
	* ebdb.info: Actually, I forgot to re-produce the manual last time I
	 made changes.

2017-08-06  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fall back to human readable name of labeled fields

	* ebdb.el (eieio-object-name-string): Override this method, which
	 originally would have printed the symbol name of the field class if
	 the instance had no label. Instead, print the human readable name of
	 the field class.

2017-08-06  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Also snarf URL fields

	* ebdb-snarf.el (ebdb-snarf-routines): Add a new element to this list.
	* ebdb.org: Mention in docs.

2017-08-06  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Rework snarf collection

	* ebdb-snarf.el (ebdb-snarf-collect): Completely re-write this
	 function, it now searches for "clusters" of field information, and
	 creates a bundle from each cluster. This should be a significant
	 improvement over the previous implementation, modulo bugs. This
	 function is no longer responsible for going to point-min, it only
	 moves forward.
	 (ebdb-snarf): This function goes to point min.
	* ebdb-test.el (ebdb-snarf-mail-and-name): Adjust tests. Snarfing will
	 no longer look over multiple lines if we're not at bol. Also, as
	 this test doesn't call ebdb-snarf, we need to go to point-min
	 ourselves.
	* ebdb.org: Documentation tweak.

2017-08-06  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Remove stray code

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-subint): Delete this function, it wasn't used
	 anywhere.

2017-08-06  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Create ebdb-parse method for URL fields

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-url-valid-schemes): First, a customization option for
	 valid URL schemes.
	 (ebdb-parse): Then a parse method. Check that the scheme is valid,
	 raise 'ebdb-unparseable otherwise.

2017-08-06  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Half-implement signature snarfing for MUAs

	* ebdb-com.el: Remove commented-out customization option regarding
	 signature snarfing. This would have implemented automated snarfing,
	 which would have been a nightmare. Only snarf on user command.
	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-mua-get-signature): New generic method for
	 returning the text of a message signature.
	 (ebdb-mua-snarf-article): Add signature snarfing as a part of this
	 function. Perhaps we'll want a separate function later?
	* ebdb-gnus.el (ebdb-mua-get-signature): Implement for Gnus, figure
	 out the others later.

2017-08-04  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	When merging organization records, possibly merge role fields

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-merge): When two organizations are merged, it's
	 reasonable to expect that role fields pointing to both orgs should
	 be preserved and moved to point to the "new" org. Ask the user if
	 that's the case.

2017-08-03  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Mention role fields in the manual

	* ebdb.org(Role Fields): New manual section.
	* ebdb.info: etc
	* ebdb.texi: etc

2017-08-02  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Don't need so much docstring on ebdb-mode

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-mode): Most of this information is now in the
	 manual, and dumping the mode map is enough for the rest of it.

2017-08-02  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Set local variable correctly in manual

	* ebdb.org: Much easier to set at top of file (and previous version
	 was wrong, anyway).

2017-08-02  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add instructions for writing i18n libraries to manual

	* ebdb.org (Writing Internationalization Libraries): New section.
	* ebdb.info: etc
	* ebdb.texi: etc

2017-07-31  tumashu  <tumashu@163.com>

	Let ebdb-complete can grab string which similar "guix-devel" (#46)

	

2017-07-30  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add test for with-record-edits macro

	* ebdb-test.el (ebdb-test-with-record-edits): I'm least confident
	 about this macro.

2017-07-30  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add test for multiple databases plus read only

	* ebdb-test.el (ebdb-load-record-multiple-databases-error): Editing a
	 record should raise an error if one of its databases is read only.

2017-07-29  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Basic finished version of manual

	Fixes #8

	* ebdb.org: Mainly added more stuff about EBDB buffers and ebdb-mode.
	* ebdb.texi:
	* ebdb.info: Produce new manual.
	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-info): This command can now be used correctly.

2017-07-29  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Check db editable before reading new record

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-create-record): Move the ebdb-db-editable check
	 before record reading, don't make the user enter a whole record and
	 then find out afterwards it isn't going to work.

2017-07-29  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	When inserting fields, read the field but insert a clone

	Fixes #43

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-insert-field): Read field, then insert clone. This
	 ensures that, when inserting a field into multiple records, each
	 record gets its own copy that it can manipulate itself, if it needs
	 to.

2017-07-29  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix bug in reading mail alias fields

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-read): Why was there a "car" in there?

2017-07-29  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix bug in ebdb-char-fold-search logic

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-search): Parenthesis has to go all the way around,
	 smart guy.

2017-07-29  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Mark arg as used in call to ebdb-with-record-edits

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-edit-field-customize): Arg is being used in macro
	 expansion.

2017-07-29  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix buffer modification call

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-create-record): Same error I made on the other
	 end, un-setting the modification flag.

2017-07-29  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix propertize call when formatting field values

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-fmt-field): Looks like this was copy-paste bug
	 propagation.

2017-07-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Small tweaks to README

	* README.org: Various small edits.

2017-07-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Mention record citing in the manual

	* ebdb.org (Citing Record): New section.

2017-07-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Mention Org integration in the manual

	* ebdb.org (Org Integration): Links and all that.

2017-07-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Mention support for completion frameworks in manual

	* ebdb.org (Completion): There's not a lot to say.

2017-07-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Mention all supported MUAs in manual

	* ebdb.org: And sneakily fix a few errors.

2017-07-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Start tracking manual texi and info files

	* ebdb.info:
	* ebdb.texi: Track new files

2017-07-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Mention vCard export support in manual

	* ebdb.org (vCard Support): Mention what we've got, such as it is.

2017-07-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Mention mail aliases in the manual

	* ebdb.org (Mail Aliases): New section.

2017-07-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Mention internationalization library in the manual

	* ebdb.org (Internationalization): New section.

2017-07-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Expand manual, and edit for use of ox-texinfo-plus

	* ebdb.org: The ox-texinfo-plus package has some nice tweaks for
	 writing Emacs manuals.

2017-07-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Modify ebdb-mua-yank-cc to yank from any EBDB buffer

	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-mua-yank-cc): Otherwise what's the point, really?
	 If it only yanks from the EBDB buffer associated with the message
	 composition buffer, all message recipients are already in the EBDB
	 buffer.

2017-07-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Move, rename and bind ebdb-mail-yank

	* ebdb-com.el: Remove ebdb-mail-yank from this file.
	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-mua-yank-cc): Put it here, and give it a new name.

2017-07-28  tumashu  <tumashu@163.com>

	require pyim, for chinese-pyim has been renamed to pyim (#45)

	

2017-07-23  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fairly embarrassing oversight in setting ebdb buffers modified

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-with-record-edits): We'll need to actually use the
	 buffer...

2017-07-23  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Large pile of manual, docstring, and comment edits

	* ebdb-mua.el: Some new information, but mostly typo and reformatting
	 edits.
	* ebdb.org: Mostly new information regarding MUA changes.  Also, start
	 reformatting for the use of ox-texinfo-plus, though a future commit
	 will focus on that.

2017-07-23  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Create specific keymap for using EBDB in MUAs

	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-mua-keymap): New keymap, to be bound to a certain
	 key (aiming for ";" in all cases) in the MUA. This means everything
	 is now two keystrokes, but there's a lot more room for growth.
	* ebdb-rmail.el: Bind in rmail.
	* ebdb-mu4e.el: Bind in mu4e.
	* ebdb-mhe.el: Bind in mhe.
	* ebdb-gnus.el: Bind in Gnus.
	* ebdb-message.el: Do *not* bind in either mail-mode or message-mode.
	 The keymap as it stands is pretty tied to message-reading MUAs.
	 Consider something separate for message-sending MUAs.

2017-07-23  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Simplify MUA record editing

	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-mua-edit-field): Remove both option and command of
	 this name.
	 (ebdb-mua-edit-field-sender, ebdb-mua-edit-field-recipients): Remove
	 both commands.
	 (ebdb-mua-edit-sender-notes): New, simpler command that only edits
	 the notes field of the message sender.	 All other edits should be
	 done with auto-update, message snarfing, or ebdb-mua-in-ebdb-buffer.

2017-07-23  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	New function ebdb-mua-in-ebdb-buffer

	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-mua-in-ebdb-buffer): New function, a bit
	 experimental.	Call it to temporarily move point to the pop-up EBDB
	 buffer associated with the current MUA.  Re-wires "q" to return to
	 the previous window configuration.  Don't document or bind for now.

2017-07-23  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Combine with previous commit

	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-mua-annotate-field-interactive,
	 ebdb-mua-annotate-sender, ebdb-mua-annotate-recipients,
	 ebdb-annotate-field): These functions/options should have been
	 deleted as part of the last commit.

2017-07-22  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Drop the whole auto-notes thing

	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-annotate-record, ebdb-auto-notes): Remove these
	 functions, the whole thing was too convoluted.	 There was no way to
	 only run the rules once, and why would you want to run them multiple
	 times?

2017-07-22  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Reinstate the notice record hook, and move notice-record method

	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-notice-record-hook): I'd previously deleted this,
	 now put it back.
	 (ebdb-notice-record): Move this generic and method into this file,
	 it belongs here.  Call the notice-record-hook as part of the
	 notice-record method.
	* ebdb.el: Remove ebdb-notice-record from this file.

2017-07-22  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Pop up empty *EBDB* buffer for users with no records

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-search-display): Calling `ebdb' usually doesn't
	 open a buffer if no results are found. Users starting out with EBDB
	 won't have any records at all. In that case, pop up an empty buffer.
	* ebdb.org: Document.

2017-07-21  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Split ebdb-org-open into two functions

	* ebdb-org.el (ebdb-org-retrieve): New function only parses an Org
	 link and retrieves the matching records (doesn't display them).
	 (ebdb-org-open): This function now only calls `ebdb-org-retrieve'
	 and displays the results.

2017-06-27  tumashu  <tumashu@163.com>

	ebdb-complete: Add mail-mode support (#44)

	

2017-06-10  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Adjust indentation of multi-line field values

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-fmt-record-body): I'm still pretty skeptical about
	 this -- I don't know why it works this way, and still wish I could
	 just use `fill-paragraph' correctly.

2017-06-10  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Rework ebdb-mail-yank

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-mail-yank): It still isn't bound to a key, but now
	 it works in both message-mode and mail-mode.

2017-06-01  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Mark EBDB buffers as modified after edits

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-with-record-edits, ebdb-create-record): Mark
	 all *EBDB* buffers as modified.

2017-06-01  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Use ebdb-with-record-edits in more places

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-edit-field, ebdb-delete-field-or-record): I
	 believe ebdb-create-record is the only editing command that doesn't
	 use this macro now.

2017-05-29  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Mark EBDB buffers as unmodified after save

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-save): After ebdb-save, all *EBDB* buffers should be
	 "unmodified".

2017-04-05  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fixes to record loading

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-db-add-record): Don't call `ebdb-db-load-records'
	 here. It seemed like a neat way to re-use the loading procedure, but
	 the uuid check will raise an error with the record's own self as a
	 duplicate. There's no need to use something that deep anyway, this
	 method should be kept straightforward. This fixes moving/copying
	 records between databases.
	 (ebdb-delete-record, ebdb-init-record): Clean up code in here
	 somewhat.
	* ebdb-test.el (ebdb-test-database-2): Add a second test database.
	 (ebdb-test-with-database): Fix dumb macro mistake.
	 (ebdb-load-record-multiple-databases): Test multiple

2017-04-02  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Change type of anniversary field dates

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-field-anniversary): Used to be absolute number of
	 days, now store lists of month, day, year.  The whole point is to
	 allow unknown years.
	 (initialize-instance): "Migrate" values from previous type.
	 (ebdb-read, ebdb-string, ebdb-field-anniversary-calendar,
	 ebdb-field-anniversary-agenda, ebdb-field-anniv-diary-entry): Fix
	 everything accordingly.
	* ebdb-migrate.el (ebdb-migrate-vector-to-class): Change migration
	 routine accordingly.

2017-03-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Allow custom hash predicates

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-hash-extra-predicates): New option allowing users to
	 create their own hash predicates. This allows them to add arbitrary
	 hash entries to the ebdb-hashtable, and filter hash lookup results
	 with their own predicates.
	 (ebdb-hash-p): Check new option.

2017-03-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix bug in MUA record creation

	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-annotate-message): Mail cannot be given as a list,
	 this was left over from a (setf (slot-value...

2017-03-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix docstring of ebdb-create-record

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-create-record): Extended create is done with a
	 separate command, not with the prefix argument.

2017-03-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Temporarily abandon having record-change-name accept strings

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-record-change-name): I've found no way to actually
	 make this work. I can't switch from a string argument to a
	 ebdb-field-name argument. There has to be some solution to this, but
	 I'm giving up for now.
	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-annotate-message): Alter function to check for
	 name class explicity.

2017-03-20  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Put a load protection in ebdb-mua-update-records

	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-mua-update-records): This is one of the points we
	 might hit where ebdb hasn't been loaded yet.

2017-03-20  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Protect against no current record when redisplaying

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-redisplay-records): Code originally called
	 `ebdb-current-record' with no prior checks, this could easily throw
	 an error.

2017-03-20  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Change arg order of record-insert|delete-field, refactor

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-record-insert-field, ebdb-record-delete-field): The
	 slot argument now comes last, and is optional. Also, add
	 defgenerics.
	* ebdb-snarf.el (ebdb-snarf-query): Remove field slot queries, and
	 handle new arg order (mostly dropping the slot argument).
	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-mua-edit-field): Ditto.
	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-delete-records, ebdb-edit-field): Ditto.
	* ebdb-test.el: New tests for adding/deleting/changing fields.

2017-03-18  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Record-insert|delete-field methods can find their own slots

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-record-insert-field, ebdb-record-delete-field):
	 Provide implementation of these methods where slot is nil, they find
	 the slot, and then pass off to more specific methods.

	Step one in refactoring ebdb-record-field-slot-query inside of 
	ebdb-record-insert|delete-field.

2017-03-18  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Change ebdb-record-change-name to accept strings

	The fact that person and organization record types take different name 
	classes is still causing a little difficulty. We address this by 
	allowing ebdb-record-change-name to accept a string argument, meaning 
	that the parsing can happen within the record-class-specific method. 
	That should remove most of the leaky abstractions from various points in
	the code.

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-record-change-name): Provide a generic, for eldoc
	 purposes. Provide person- and organization-specific methods that can
	 accept strings. Take care of business inside those methods. Also,
	 only set the 'name-string cache slot within the base method.
	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-edit-field): Adjust for new system -- it's
	 necessary to read the new name here: do it with the right class, and
	 the old instance as default.
	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-annotate-message): Destroy "name-slot" with
	 maximum prejudice.

2017-03-17  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Get notice routine working

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-notice-record): Provide generic and method for
	 ebdb-notice-record.
	 (ebdb-notice-field): Provide generic, and change calling signature
	 to remove the message-headers argument. There's no
	 immediately-convenient way to pass the headers in to the method.
	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-update-records): Put the ebdb-notice-record call
	 in the right place.
	* ebdb-gnorb.el (ebdb-fmt-field, ebdb-notice-field): Fix these two
	 methods to work with the new noticing routine.
	 (gnorb-ebdb-collect-by-thread): Allow for collecting/opening by
	 thread.
	 (ebdb-gnorb-lapsed-days): Helper function, stolen from
	 article-lapsed-days.

2017-03-15  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Change databases' buffer-char slot into actual character

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-db): Should be stored as an actual character.
	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-record-db-char-string): Display as such.

2017-03-15  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fill out functionality of gnorb messages field

	Though the "notice" plumbing isn't actually hooked up yet! Actually this
	should be disconnected from Gnorb altogether (in fact it already is,
	there's no use of Gnorb in this file at all), and the field should be
	made capable of collecting and following links from any MUA, not just
	Gnus. We'll get there.

	* ebdb-gnorb.el (gnorb-ebdb): New group.
	 (gnorb-ebdb-collect-N-messages, gnorb-ebdb-define-recent,
	 gnorb-ebdb-message-format): Customization options all stolen from
	 Gnorb.
	 (gnorb-ebdb-follow-link): New function for following a link.
	 (ebdb-fmt-field, ebdb-string): Functions for formatting field
	 contents.
	 (ebdb-notice-field): Notice field method for storing links.

2017-03-14  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Split out ebdb-notice-record and ebdb-notice-field methods

	* ebdb.el: (ebdb-notice-field, ebdb-notice-record): Not that either of
	 them actually do anything yet.

2017-03-12  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	New method: ebdb-db-load-records

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-db-load-records): Separate out the ebdb-db-load and
	 ebdb-db-load-records processes, so that we can call
	 ebdb-db-load-records separately, even after db is loaded.
	 (ebdb-db-add-record): This method now uses ebdb-db-load-records on
	 newly-added records. This allows our uuid checking and merging
	 process to kick in when adding records, not only when loading the
	 database.

2017-03-12  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Don't wrap cl-print-object in eval-when-compile

	* ebdb.el (cl-print-object): Probably unnecessary, and the compiler
	 didn't like it.

2017-03-11  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Code tweaks and re-arrangments

	Inspired by the compiler, and tumashu's bug report. Make sure all 
	functions and variables are required, autoloaded, defvar'd, or otherwise
	available.

	Fixes #41.

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-canonicalize-mail-function,
	 ebdb-message-clean-name-function): Biggest change is that these two
	 customization options have been moved here from ebdb-mua.el, and
	 switched to the 'ebdb-utilities defgroup. They aren't MUA
	 specific (we should use them in snarfing, for one thing), and the
	 functions they point to by default are already in ebdb.el.

2017-03-11  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Require ebdb-format in ebdb-vcard

	Fixes #40

	* ebdb-vcard.el: Not sure how this never bit me before.

2017-03-10  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Migration should guard against unparseable emails

	* ebdb-migrate.el (ebdb-migrate-vector-to-class): Make sure we
	 actually found an email address in there.

2017-03-10  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix record citation

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-records-cite): First, rename from
	 ebdb-records-cite-mail. Interactive command is now called
	 `ebdb-cite-records', and underlying methods called
	 `ebdb-records-cite'. Also, fix bug in `ebdb-records-cite'.

2017-03-10  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add counsel-ebdb.el

	* counsel-ebdb.el: For completing using the counsel/ivy interface.
	 Command name is also `counsel-ebdb'. Eventually these will get split
	 off into different packages.

2017-03-09  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Change newline approach in vCard handling

	* ebdb-vcard.el (ebdb-formatter-vcard): Instead of actually sticking
	 CRLFs in the code everywhere, do it right: use Emacs' internal
	 conventions, and only convert to 'utf-8-dos at the last minute, when
	 saving to file. Go back through all code and revert to using plain
	 \n. The formatting routine is already prepared to set the file
	 coding system correctly.
	 (ebdb-formatter-vcard-40): Don't override coding-system here.
	 (ebdb-vcard-escape): Fix escaping.
	* ebdb-test.el (ebdb-vcard-escape/unescape): I had written a broken
	 test to test broken code. Fix the test.
	 (ebdb-vcard-fold/unfold): Also get literal CRLFs out of here, back
	 to plain \n.

	Lastly, after this, we need to find the right spot to run the 
	folding/unfolding routine.

2017-03-09  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	New functions for folding/unfolding long vCard lines

	* ebdb-vcard.el (ebdb-vcard-fold-lines, ebdb-vcard-unfold-lines): RFC
	 says lines longer than 75 octets must be folded.  Folding consists
	 of CRLF followed immediate by space or tab.
	* ebdb-test.el (ebdb-vcard-fold/unfold): Test new functions.

2017-03-08  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	All vCard lines should be delimited with CRLF

	* ebdb-vcard.el: Probably safer to enforce this from the very
	 beginning.

2017-03-08  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Remove unused customization groups

	* ebdb.el: And reformat some stuff.

2017-03-08  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Don't use copy-sequence plus add-text-properties on strings

	* ebdb-com.el: That's exactly what `propertize' is there for.

2017-03-07  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Expand ebdb-helm to complete on mails as well

	* helm-ebdb.el (helm-ebdb-candidates): Strings in the candidate list
	 should also include record email addresses.
	 (helm-ebdb-compose-mail): For records with multiple email addresses,
	 prompt for the address to use.

2017-03-07  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add option for character fold searching

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-search): First of all, new defgroup.
	 (ebdb-case-fold-search, ebdb-search-transform-functions): Part of
	 this group.
	 (ebdb-char-fold-search): New boolean customization option for
	 enabling char-fold searching.
	 (ebdb-search): Take new option into account.
	* ebdb-test.el (ebdb-search-transform-and-fold): Test new stuff.
	* ebdb.org (Changing Search Behavior): Document new stuff.

2017-03-07  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	More search functions can use prefixes: mention in manual

	* ebdb.org: (Searching): These three commands can take the prefix now.

2017-03-07  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Remove redundant customization group ebdb-utilities-snarf

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-snarf): Just use 'ebdb-snarf as the group name.
	* ebdb-snarf.el: But move it from this file to ebdb.el.

2017-03-06  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add close parenthesis to email regexp delimiter

	* ebdb-snarf.el (ebdb-snarf-routines): Had it in the pre, but not in
	 the post.
	* ebdb-test.el (ebdb-snarf-mail-and-name): Test for this.

2017-03-03  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix vCard formatting for anniversaries

	* ebdb-vcard.el (ebdb-fmt-field): There will be more cases to handle
	 than just this, but this ought to do it for now.

2017-03-03  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Apparently I was spelling vCard wrong

	* ebdb-vcard.el: Oh, the shame.

2017-03-03  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add vcard unescaping, and some vcard tests

	* ebdb-vcard.el (ebdb-vcard-unescape): New function, also expand
	 `ebdb-vcard-escape' so it doesn't double-escape. And fix bug
	 revealed by testing.
	* ebdb-test.el (ebdb-vcard-escape/unescape,
	 ebdb-vcard-export-dont-explode): New tests for some of this stuff.

2017-03-03  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Bump to version 0.2

	* ebdb.el: Just because.

2017-03-03  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Include addresses in vcard output, plus escaping

	* ebdb-vcard.el (ebdb-vcard-escape): Escape commas and semicolons, as
	 per vcard RFC. Use where appropriate
	 (ebdb-fmt-field): Add formatting method for addresses.

2017-03-03  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Migrate more search routines to the ebdb-search-display thing

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-search-database, ebdb-search-record-class,
	 ebdb-search-modified): These three commands now use the internal
	 searching routine. Also, rename `ebdb-search-changed' to
	 `ebdb-search-modified'.
	* ebdb.el (ebdb-record-search): New symbol-keyed methods for searching
	 using the above commands.

	These search options are now actually *less* efficient than they were 
	before, but this allows you to use them with the filter/append prefixes.

2017-03-03  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Last tweak to pop-up buffers

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-pop-up-window): If we're doing it manually, "buf"
	 needs to go in as a buffer object, not a string. This might get
	 fixed in master, but use `get-buffer' anyway. It's also necessary to
	 add a call to `set-window-prev-buffers', so that the window history
	 is nil, and it will be killed when the buffer is quit.

2017-03-02  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix stupidity

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-search): First, "criterion" was unused. Second, the
	 whole thing was broken. There are tests for a reason; run them
	 before you push, idiot.
	 (ebdb-field-phone-signal-text): Sneak this in.

2017-03-02  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Drop object-print for cl-print-object

	* ebdb.el (cl-print-object): If this method is available, use it.
	 Otherwise, don't bother with `object-print', it's not useful enough
	 to want to maintain alongside the former. We've defined
	 `cl-print-object' for records, database, name fields, mail fields,
	 and phone fields.

2017-03-02  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Shift transformation of search strings into ebdb-search

	Fixes #39

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-search-read): This originally happened in an :around
	 method on `ebdb-search-read'. There was no reason to limit
	 transformation to interactive input of search strings, though.
	 (ebdb-search): Instead, move it into the more fundamental
	 `ebdb-search', where it will affect all searches.

2017-03-01  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	ebdb-parse-i18n for Chinese phones should pass class arg through

	* ebdb-chn.el (ebdb-parse-i18n): Pass it through to make-instance,
	 don't assume.

2017-03-01  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix condition-case catch in ebdb-i18n-* methods

	* ebdb-i18n.el (ebdb-read): In this and all the other :extra methods
	 in this file, catch the more-general cl-no-method signal, rather
	 than chasing one of cl-no-applicable-method or cl-no-primary-method.
	 See code comments at top of file for reason.
	* ebdb-i18n-test.el (ebdb-i18n-parse-unhandled-name,
	 ebdb-i18n-parse-unhandled-phone): Test for these conditions.

2017-03-01  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Search read transform functions needs to work for all methods

	Addresses #39

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-search-read): This :around method was previously only
	 firing for method calls that involved subclasses of ebdb-field. I
	 forgot there are several other types of call, the transformation
	 needs to work for all of them.

2017-02-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix to UUID change

	Update to 40d71b9, addresses #38

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-make-uuid): Need to actually check if the executable
	 is found.

2017-02-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	New label/field alist for vcard export

	Addresses #2

	* ebdb-vcard.el (ebdb-vcard-label-alist): New customization option, an
	 alist mapping Vcard string labels to field class names.  This is
	 another step towards Vcard import/parsing; this alist will be used
	 in that process.

2017-02-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Be more forgiving about contents of BBDB file when migrating

	* ebdb-migrate.el (ebdb-migrate-parse-records): Make fewer
	 assumptions. Just search forward for something that looks like the
	 beginning of a record.

2017-02-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Be more when careful migrating timestamps

	* ebdb-migrate.el (ebdb-migrate-vector-to-class): The BBDB timestamps
	 may be missing hour/minute/second values, in which case replace
	 those nils with 0s.

2017-02-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Specify class of name fields when updating from MUA

	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-annotate-message): Don't just parse as
	 `ebdb-field-name, as that can result in person records getting a
	 field-name-simple, which results in an error, which results in a
	 record with no name being added to the database, which results in
	 more errors. All this is desperately in need of refactoring, but for
	 the time being this will do.

2017-02-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Expand gnus-user-format-function-%s

	* ebdb-gnus.el (ebdb-insinuate-gnus): Incorporate the guts of
	 `gnus-summary-from-or-to-or-newsgroups', so that we get the proper
	 behavior in sent-message/archive groups. Essentially, make
	 `gnus-user-format-function-E' behave like Gnus' %f formatting code,
	 rather than %F. Copying code is bad, it would be nice if this could
	 be refactored out.

2017-02-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Revert changes to pop-up routine.

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-pop-up-window): I'd changed from `split-window' to
	 `display-buffer', because the quit configuration was better. But the
	 splitting behavior was wonky, so I'm changing back. Still have to
	 solve the quit-restore problem, though.

2017-02-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Steal UUID generating function from Org

	Fixes #38

	* ebdb.el (ebdb--make-uuid): Fallback in case there's no uuidgen
	 program on the system.
	 (ebdb-make-uuid): Use it.

2017-02-26  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Autoload calendar-absolute-from-gregorian

	* ebdb.el: Compiler is angry otherwise.

2017-02-26  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Move ebdb-message-search to ebdb.el

	* ebdb-com.el: It shouldn't be in here.
	* ebdb.el: Move it here.

2017-02-26  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add Makefile

	* Makefile: World's dumbest Makefile, and it doesn't even work: byte
	 compilation fails because it relies on external packages, and
	 tests in ebdb-i18n-test.el fail for the same reason. At least the
	 main tests run.

2017-02-26  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Support sending text messages via Signal

	Addresses #37

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-signal-program): Customization option for locating the
	 signal-cli program.
	 (ebdb-field-phone-signal-text): Phone field action for sending
	 texts.
	 (ebdb-signal-text): Another general command for sending Signal
	 texts.
	 (ebdb-signal-get-number): Extract a usable Signal phone number from
	 a record.
	 (ebdb--signal-text): Internal function for actually sending the
	 text.

2017-02-25  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Make sure database files are decoded as utf-8-emacs

	Addresses #35

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-load): Database objects will be loaded correctly no
	 matter what, this only affects the case where someone visits a
	 database persistence file directly.

2017-02-25  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Tweaks to testing macros, more tests

	* ebdb-test.el (ebdb-test-with-database, ebdb-test-with-records):
	 These macros didn't need to be so complicated. Plain `let' was
	 enough.
	* ebdb-test.el (ebdb-address-decompose): Add tests for the
	 `ebdb-decompose-ebdb-address' function.  Split out name and mail
	 parsing tests.
	* ebdb.el (ebdb-decompose-ebdb-address): Fix bugs found in test.
	 (ebdb-parse): Turns out notes fields were missing an `ebdb-parse'
	 method.

2017-02-25  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Write generics for ebdb-db-add/remove-record

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-db-add-record, ebdb-db-remove-record): Mostly for
	 eldoc purposes.

2017-02-25  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Allow user transformation of search strings

	Addresses #23

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-search-transform-functions): New custom option -- a
	 list of functions used to transform search strings.
	 (ebdb-search-read): Add an :around method that runs search strings
	 through the functions in the above method.

2017-02-23  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Compiler-inspired fixes, volume 5453

2017-02-23  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Snarfing shouldn't pop up its own window

	* ebdb-snarf.el (ebdb-snarf): If any *EBDB* buffer is visible, assume
	 that buffer is relevant to the snarfing and re-use it.	 But pass the
	 "append" argument so we don't clobber what was in there to begin
	 with.

2017-02-23  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Mild hack to make pop up windows work well

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-pop-up-window): Make sure window splits.  See code
	 comment.

2017-02-23  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Expand ebdb-test-save-vars to save ebdb-db-list as well

	* ebdb-test.el (ebdb-test-save-vars): Save value of ebdb-db-list, too.
	 (ebdb-test-with-database): Nest `ebdb-test-save-vars' inside this
	 macro.

2017-02-22  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Basic tests for EBDB's internationalization support

	* ebdb-i18n-test.el: Not much in here, but it's a start.

2017-02-22  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Internationalized ebdb-parse method for names must accept slots arg

	Addresses #33

	* ebdb-chn.el (ebdb-parse-i18n): Both these methods must handle a
	 "slots" argument.
	* ebdb-i18n.el (ebdb-parse)

2017-02-22  tumashu  <tumashu@163.com>

	Add ebdb-complete.el (#32)

	

2017-02-21  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Provide internationalized ebdb-string and ebdb-parse for phones

	Fixes #29

	* ebdb-i18n.el (ebdb-string, ebdb-parse): Provide internationalized
	 hooks keyed on the integer country code.
	* ebdb-chn.el (ebdb-string-i18n, ebdb-parse-i18n): Implement for
	 Chinese phone numbers.

2017-02-21  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	ebdb-parse-i18n must also accept a slots argument

	* ebdb-i18n.el (ebdb-parse-i18n): Otherwise it won't preserve existing
	 slot values, in particular a label.

2017-02-20  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	More informative warning when deleting record fields

	Fixes #25

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-delete-field-or-record): Make it very clear which
	 field is going to be deleted.

2017-02-20  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	If alt-names search fails, fall back on actual name field search

	Relevant to #23

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-record-search): Name searches now try the cache first,
	 but fall back to actual `ebdb-field-search' on the name instances.
	 This is to allow overrides of `ebdb-field-search' to take effect. It
	 may slow search down too much.

2017-02-20  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Change keybinding for ebdb-prev-field

	Fixes #27

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-mode-map): "DEL" was a weird choice.

	Thanks to Tumashu (Feng Shu) for all the bug discovery and suggestions.

2017-02-20  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Handle formatting to a fake *EBDB* buffer

	Fixes #26

	* ebdb-format.el (ebdb-format-to-tmp-buffer): It's possible for the
	 user to choose a *EBDB* formatter when formatting to tmp buffer.  In
	 that case, output a buffer containing what the *EBDB* buffer would
	 have contained, but then remove all properties and put it in text
	 mode.

2017-02-20  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Remove final references to ebdb-print

	Fixes #28

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-menu): It was still callable from the menu.

2017-02-20  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Use ebdb-field-search in notes-type record searches

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-record-search): Everything should go through
	 ebdb-field-search.

	Relevant to #23

2017-02-19  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	More tests

	* ebdb-test.el (ebdb-test-with-database, ebdb-test-save-vars): Macros
	 for set-up and protection against polluting a running EBDB
	 environment.
	 (ebdb-test-database-1): Make a temp file name for creating a test
	 database.
	 (ebdb-make-database, ebdb-read-database, ebdb-database-unsynced,
	 ebdb-make-record, ebdb-add-record): New tests.

2017-02-19  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add protection around ebdb-record-uuid

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-record-uuid): The slot value might not even be
	 present.

2017-02-18  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fixes to proper name formatting, part III

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-init-field): Get the variable names right.
	 (ebdb-delete-field): And reverse operations here.

	Need to go on a new-code diet. Only tests for five days.

2017-02-18  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Save match data around ebdb-parse-i18n

	* ebdb-i18n.el (ebdb-parse-i18n): Parse methods are likely to using
	 regexp matching, save match data around them.

2017-02-18  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Don't assume Chinese names have both surname and given-names

	* ebdb-chn.el (ebdb-string-i18n): Allow nil values for either.

2017-02-18  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Yet more fixes to proper name formatting

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-name-fl): Pass the "full" flag to ebdb-name-given.
	 (ebdb-string): By default return the full name.
	 (ebdb-init-field): Hash against name both with and without full
	 given names.

	Further fixes to problems revealed by 927c2ac.	A back-and-forth pass 
	through ebdb-string --> ebdb-parse --> ebdb-string should always be 
	idempotent.  That means use full given names everywhere by default, and
	only remove middle names for convenience.

	Now middle names are displayed by default in *EBDB* buffers.  We'll 
	probably want a customization option for that.

2017-02-18  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Pop up EBDB buffer when using company to complete

	* company-ebdb.el (company-ebdb--post-complete): New post-completion
	 command.  When using company-mode to complete names, pop up the
	 buffer same as if we'd used TAB.

2017-02-18  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix ebdb-delete-redundant-mails

	Fixes #22

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-delete-redundant-mails): Had not been updated to
	 use classes, etc.

2017-02-18  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Protect gnus stuff behind eval-after-load

	Fixes #24

	* ebdb-message.el: Don't assume Gnus is loaded.

2017-02-17  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Stupid mistake in previous commit

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-name-fl): This is what I get for hasty commits.

2017-02-17  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Be more careful about name formatting

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-name-given): If there's no given name, don't do
	 anything with it.
	 (ebdb-name-fl): Don't assume that any name elements are present.
	 Format accordingly.

2017-02-17  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Increase base field indentation in *EBDB* buffers

	Addresses #21

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-fmt-record-body): Give field values a little more
	 default indentation.

2017-02-17  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix menu entry of ebdb-create-record

	Addresses #21

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-menu): It was listed as `ebdb-create', which no
	 longer exists.

2017-02-17  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	When replying to messages, start with a populated EBDB buffer

	* ebdb-message.el: We've already got contacts to display, so create
	 an *EBDB* buffer right off the bat, and use gnus window
	 configuration to make sure it's displayed.

2017-02-17  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	New ebdb-message-buffer-name subst

	* ebdb-message.el (ebdb-message-buffer-name): "Write it twice then
	 refactor".  Just about to write it the third time.

2017-02-17  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add safety check to ebdb-undisplay-records

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-undisplay-records): It's possible we could be
	 passed a non-existent buffer.

2017-02-17  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Clear *EBDB-Message* buffers when composing new message

	* ebdb-message.el (ebdb-insinuate-message): EBDB buffers associated
	 with message-mode and mail-mode don't get cleared by default, do it
	 manually.

2017-02-17  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Check for existence of fiel-attribute-modification-time

	Fixes #19

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-db-unsynced): It was added in Emacs 26.1.

2017-02-16  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Change signature of ebdb-undisplay-records

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-undisplay-records): When would you ever want to
	 undisplay all EBDB buffers?  Instead, either pass an explicit BUFFER
	 argument, or use `ebdb-make-buffer-name' to find the buffer to
	 undisplay.  Should be much more useful.

2017-02-16  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Missing local variable binding

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-display-records): Add "start" to let bindings.

2017-02-16  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Very basic test setup

	* ebdb-test.el: New file containing tests for EBDB.  Very few tests at
	 this point.  Most crucial to test parsing and snarfing -- anything
	 involving regexps.

2017-02-16  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix parsing of suffixes in names

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-divide-name): This function wasn't actually returning
	 the suffix as a separate element.
	 (ebdb-parse): Catch the suffix element and store it in the correct
	 slot.

2017-02-16  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Remove spurious ebdb-record-search implementation

	* ebdb.el: We no longer dispatch on the 'name symbol, only on the
	 'ebdb-field-name class symbol.

2017-02-16  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Update company-ebdb for new search behavior

	* company-ebdb.el (company-ebdb--candidates): These search criteria
	 can no longer be passed in as plain symbols, only as class-name
	 symbols.

2017-02-16  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Remove this empty file

	* test.txt: Don't remember what this was here for.

2017-02-16  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Remove unused code

	* ebdb.el: Remove `ebdb-merge-concat',
	 `ebdb-merge-concat-remove-duplicates', `ebdb-merge-string-least',
	 `ebdb-merge-string-most' and `ebdb-merge-lists'.  They aren't used
	 anywhere.

2017-02-15  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Allow for characters before mail addresses when snarfing

	* ebdb-snarf.el (ebdb-snarf-routines): Basically, when there are
	 certain characters before a mail address in the buffer, ignore them
	 and look for a name on the line above.

2017-02-15  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Bah, fixups to a19ff0a

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-pop-up-window): Compile and test first, why don't
	 you?

2017-02-15  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix autoloads in ebdb.el

	* ebdb-com.el: First of all, remove `ebdb-dwim-mail' from this file.
	* ebdb.el: And add it here.  It's a general-use function, it shouldn't
	 be in ebdb-com.el.  Also adjust autoloads: half of the autoloaded
	 functions weren't being used in this file, and nothing here should
	 ever depend on ebdb-com.el.  Lastly, there's no need to wrap in
	 `eval-when-compile': the autoloads should be available at load and
	 compile times.

2017-02-15  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Tweaks and additions to manual

	* ebdb.org: Various.

2017-02-15  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Simplify pop-up window splitting

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-pop-up-window): Use `display-buffer' with
	 `display-buffer-pop-up-window' rather than `split-window'.  This is
	 a bit of an experiment -- doing it this way means we're no longer
	 able to specify horizontal vs vertical splitting, and instead rely
	 on Emacs to DTRT.  The upside is that Emacs will DTRT, and the
	 resulting buffers are easier to use (the quit configuration is set
	 correctly, mostly).

2017-02-11  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix incorrect variable name

	* ebdb-snarf.el (ebdb-snarf-query): The "name" was leftover from
	 previous iteration.

2017-02-11  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Feeding incorrect args to ebdb-snarf

	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-mua-snarf-article): Argument signature was wrong.

2017-02-11  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	VCard export is good enough

	Fixes #1, or at least close enough for now.

	* ebdb-vcard.el (ebdb-vcard-default-30-formatter,
	 ebdb-vcard-default-40-formatter): Split out these options, you'll
	 want to export to different formats at different times, and it's
	 good to start out with one of each.
	 (ebdb-fmt-process-fields): New method.	 The sole purpose of this is
	 to figure out what to do about role fields.  Our current solutions
	 is to attempt to link all related properties with the TYPE
	 parameter, which is guaranteed to screw something up somewhere.
	 Anyway, this basically works; wait for bug reports.
	 (ebdb-fmt-record): Use the above function.
	 (ebdb-fmt-record-header): Add the SORT-AS parameter to names.
	 (ebdb-fmt-field-label): Handle all different priorities of mail
	 fields.
	 (ebdb-fmt-field-label, ebdb-fmt-field): Add methods for the Org tags
	 fields.  We'll probably need autoloads here.
	* ebdb.org: Mention formatting in manual.

2017-02-11  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Provide keybinding for ebdb-format-all-records

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-mode-map): Give it the capital F.

2017-02-11  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Compiler-inspired fixes, and removal of old-code references

	Mostly just fixing compiler warnings, but also removing last references
	to xfields, etc. ebdb-vm.el is the only file that still uses
	non-existant functions.

2017-02-11  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix up actions and EBDB buffer menus

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-field): Define actions as a list of ("Descriptive
	 string" . function-name) elements.  Change all field class
	 definitions accordingly.
	 (ebdb-action): Edit accordingly.
	 (ebdb-field-relation): Make this an action, not a separate function.
	 (ebdb-field-anniversary-calendar, ebdb-field-anniversary-agenda):
	 Give anniversary fields two distinct actions.
	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-insert-field-menu): Fix field insertion menu.
	 (ebdb-record-action): Call action functions directly.
	 (ebdb-field-menu): Extract action bits accordingly.
	 (ebdb-mode-map): Use RET to call actions, not "a".

2017-02-10  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix ebdb-delete-redundant-mails

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-delete-redundant-mails): Possibly the last old
	 code in EBDB.

2017-02-10  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fixup with fix popup menus

2017-02-10  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix pop-up mouse menus in EBDB buffers

	Closes #17

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-sendmail-menu): Have to extract string from mail
	 address.
	 (ebdb-field-menu): Just loop over the field's actions.

2017-02-10  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Update copyright years to 2017

2017-02-10  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Implement popping of buffer search history

	Closes #12

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-search-history): New buffer-local defvar holding
	 search history for this EBDB buffer.  Search history is a list of
	 record uuids.
	 (ebdb-search-display): When running user-initiated searches in an
	 existing EBDB buffer, store the list of previously-displayed
	 records.
	 (ebdb-display-records): Don't call `ebdb-mode' if we're already in
	 it, as that wipes local variables.
	 (ebdb-search-pop): New command for popping history.
	* ebdb.org: Document in manual.

2017-02-09  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Rework anniversary/diary integration

	Closes #16

	* ebdb-anniv.el: Remove file.
	* ebdb.el (ebdb-anniv-use-diary): New option governing whether or not
	 we integrate with the diary.
	 (ebdb-anniv-diary-entries, ebdb-init-field, ebdb-delete-field,
	 ebdb-field-anniv-diary-entry): If we do, use the init/delete methods
	 of anniversary fields to populate the `ebdb-anniv-diary-entries'
	 list with entries that will be fed to `diary-add-to-list'.
	 (ebdb-anniv-add-entries): Add all entries from
	 `ebdb-anniv-diary-entries' to the diary using `diary-add-to-list'.
	 (ebdb-load): Add the previous function to the
	 `diary-list-entries-hook', if we're using the diary.

	There's a lot more customization to provide here, but it should *all* be
	handled in `ebdb-field-anniv-diary-entry' and
	`ebdb-anniv-add-entries'. The basic mechansism shouldn't have to change.

2017-02-09  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	First stab at article snarfing

	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-mua-snarf-article): Interactive function for
	 snarfing the text of an article in MUA.
	 (ebdb-mua-article-body): Generic function for returning the text of
	 an article.
	* ebdb-gnus.el (ebdb-mua-article-body): Implement for Gnus.

2017-02-08  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Don't ((lambda ())

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-compare-records): Use funcall instead.

	Note that none of these functions actually work, currently.

2017-02-08  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Comment out ebdb-mua-auto-snarf-signature

	* ebdb-com.el: Too soon for this.

2017-02-08  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Tiny tweak to snarfing

	* ebdb-snarf.el (ebdb-snarf-collect): Split generic-re on more things,
	 thinking specifically of names here.

2017-02-08  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix up Org link following

	* ebdb-org.el (ebdb-org-open): We have better search routines now, use
	 them.

2017-02-08  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Use string-match-p for searching on Org tags

	* ebdb-org.el (ebdb-field-search): Don't require an exact tag match,
	 allow regexps.

	Maybe we should still require exact tag matches, but somehow handle tag
	groups?

2017-02-08  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Give Org mode its own popup window

	* ebdb-org.el (ebdb-make-buffer-name): Define a method for org-mode.
	 (ebdb-org-open): Pop up a buffer when opening links.

	Eventually we should shift things so that EBDB considers Org just 
	another MUA.

2017-02-08  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Re-initialize database records after reloading

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-db-reload): After the load and initialization
	 processes were separated, we forgot to load-plus-initialize when
	 reloading a database.

2017-02-08  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Allow optional records argument to ebdb-initialize

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-initialize): Allow for initializing only a subset of
	 records (for now only used when reloading).

2017-02-07  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	More tweaks to snarfing process

	* ebdb-snarf.el (ebdb-snarf): Okay, they're mostly bugs. Was
	 clobbering the parameter name here.
	 (ebdb-snarf-collect): Pick up the correct name regexp grouping.
	 Also, special-case matching email addresses -- drop the domain part.
	 And don't match quite so much.
	 (ebdb-snarf-query): Fix bug leftover from old implementation.

2017-02-07  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix bugs in ebdb-annotate-message

	Fix bugs introduced in ed6e22

	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-annotate-message): Hard to imagine what I was
	 thinking here -- drunk coding?

2017-02-07  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Have ebdb-snarf accept optional records argument

	* ebdb-snarf.el (ebdb-snarf): It should be possible to pass this
	 argument down all the way from the top.

2017-02-06  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	First actually-working version of snarfing

	* ebdb-snarf.el (ebdb-snarf): Fix finding the correct string.
	 (ebdb-snarf-collect): Use vectors.
	 (ebdb-snarf-process): Use vectors.
	 (ebdb-snarf-query): Use vectors; work better.

	We're still only looking for mail-address fields, but the system should
	now be generalized so that simply adding elements to
	`ebdb-snarf-routines' will do the trick.

	This whole thing will look a lot better when we refactor
	`ebdb-record-field-slot-query' inside `ebdb-record-insert-field'.

2017-02-06  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Check Organization headers and display/update organization records

	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-message-headers): Add an 'organization entry to
	 this alist, and check the "Organization:" header.
	 (ebdb-annotate-message): Check the header type and create an
	 organization record if that's what we're looking at.

2017-02-05  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Compiler-inspired fixes

	* ebdb-com.el: Quote class names, delete unused variable, delete
	 second identical definition of `ebdb-search-organization'.

2017-02-05  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Simplify ebdb-dwim-mail

	* ebdb.el: Remove options `ebdb-mail-name-format' and
	 `ebdb-mail-name'. Re-instate later if people complain. If a
	 different name is desired for a particular mail address, we can use
	 the mail-aka slot.
	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-dwim-mail): Don't go to such lengths when matching
	 the name and mail user. Just a simple check for likely matches, and
	 move on. This also removes dependency on person record complex
	 names, which previously would have raised an error for an
	 organization.

2017-02-05  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Ensure that extra name field instances go in 'aka slot

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-field-name): This should subclass ebdb-field, not
	 ebdb-field-user, or else instances will go in the 'fields slot.
	 (ebdb-record-field-slot-query): Must explicitly list the types of
	 name class, and the fact they both go in the 'aka slot.

	There's actually no reason to have a separate 'aka slot -- 
	initialization and caching does everything that needs doing with name 
	instances.

2017-02-05  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	ebdb-record-search can accept symbols for search type

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-search): Don't use pcase to filter based on type.
	 Essentially we're using generic methods to filter on type.

2017-02-05  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix bug in ebdb-record-field-slot-query

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-record-field-slot-query): Checking the wrong variable.

2017-02-05  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Make ebdb-annotate-message more class agnostic

	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-annotate-message): This function was previously
	 assuming person records, and complex names. Change so that it
	 doesn't need to know what kind of record it's annotating.

2017-02-05  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Typo in ebdb-mua-check-header

	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-mua-check-header): Should be checking
	 "recipients", not "recipient".

2017-02-05  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Simplify record mail citing

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-records-cite-mail): The inline version is the same, we
	 only need one :around method. And, instead of checking if records is
	 non-nil, just use a list specializer for the records argument.

2017-02-03  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add helm-ebdb file

	This will eventually get broken off into its own package.

	* helm-ebdb.el: New file, containing basic helm integration for EBDB.
	 Provide three actions for selected candidates: display, send mail,
	 and insert name/address pair.

2017-02-03  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add EBDB record citation

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-cite-records-mail, ebdb-records-cite-mail): Add an
	 interactive function and several methods for citing record name/mail
	 pairs.	 `ebdb-cite-records-mail' is the interactive command, which
	 hands off to the `ebdb-records-cite-mail' method, which dispatches
	 on the current major mode.

2017-02-03  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	ebdb-prompt-for-record should load if necessary

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-prompt-for-record): Use (ebdb-records) rather than
	 ebdb-record-tracker, this will trigger loading if necessary.

2017-02-03  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add "Hacking EBDB" section to manual

	* ebdb.org: Add a section on hacking EBDB with new field classes and
	 methods.

2017-02-03  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Use ebdb-prompt-for-record in org link completion

	* ebdb-org.el (org-link-set-parameters): Using
	 `ebdb-prompt-for-record' is a little cleaner.

	Is there still a need for `ebdb-completing-read-record'?

2017-02-03  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Change some of the EBDB buffer formatting defaults

	* ebdb-format.el: By default, add ebdb-field-address to the :collapse
	 slot of the formatters.  Also, by default format fields using the
	 'normal style rather than the 'oneline style.

	What this means, practically, is that most fields are just output using
	`ebdb-string'.	Previously, everything was output as 'oneline, which
	meant a bunch of spurious `split-strings', now they just dump their
	whole strings.	Nothing actually specializes on 'normal, but it will hit
	the catch-all.

	Addresses are now 'collapse, which is re-routed to 'oneline by default,
	which means addresses are the only fields that get
	`split-string'ed, but it's also possible to catch 'collapse and do 
	something different.

2017-01-31  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Simplify ebdb-record-field for strings

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-record-field): If the argument is a string, just use
	 `ebdb-record-user-field' with the string as label.

2017-01-31  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Special-case mail symbol in ebdb-record-field

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-record-field): Provide special handling for 'mail, as
	 mail addresses can come from more than one place.

2017-01-31  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Wrap ebdb-parse in save-match-data

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-parse): Add :around method so parsing doesn't clobber
	 match data.

2017-01-31  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	First generalized version of snarfing

	Doesn't actually work yet, though

2017-01-31  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Simplify searching

	* ebdb-com.el: There's no reason to dispatch on symbols and then
	 create these weird data structures. Dispatch on field classes, and
	 save the symbol dispatching for strange or compound searches.
	* ebdb.el (ebdb-search): Condition-case cl-no-applicable-method.
	 (ebdb-record-search): Record search on user fields can now be much
	 simplified.

2017-01-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Refinements to snarfing

	* ebdb-snarf.el: Various improvements to snarfing. Getting closer to a
	 generalized version that will be field-class agnostic.
	* ebdb.org: Mention in manual.

2017-01-22  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Complete changes from ed3e270

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-pop-up-window): Was accessing the elements of
	 "pop" arg incorrectly.
	* ebdb-gnus.el (ebdb-popup-window): Only one of the method was using
	 the new return signature.

2017-01-21  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Merge snarf branch, basic framework of snarfing in place

	* ebdb-snarf.el (ebdb-snarf, ebdb-snarf-collect, ebdb-snarf-process):
	 Three functions that prepare the text, collect record/field
	 information from the text, and create/update/display records,
	 respectively.

	Doesn't actually do very much yet -- only recognizes mail addresses or 
	mail-plus-name.

2017-01-19  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Reverse order of args in return value of ebdb-popup-window

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-popup-window): Should now return a three-element
	 list where the horiz/vert argument is last. This is because that
	 argument is almost always nil (meaning split based on the dimensions
	 of the window in question) so we might as well leave it off.
	 (ebdb-pop-up-window): Read arg correctly, and also fix a logic bug
	 where the window would never have been split vertically.

2017-01-19  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Force mode line update after renaming EBDB buffers

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-clone-buffer): Get the new name visible in the mode
	line.

2017-01-19  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	No, that's not the proper way to create a &context catchall

	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-mua-prepare-article): Just an empty argument list
	 will do.

2017-01-19  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Manual and README additions

2017-01-19  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Short-circuit ebdb-info

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-info): Just mention the temporary Org file.

2017-01-19  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Remove ebdb-new-mails-primary

	* ebdb-mua.el: This option wasn't being used, and the whole process of
	 mail priority needs to be reworked.

2017-01-19  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Remove all pop-up-window-size type options

	At the moment, the position and size of pop-up windows are hard-coded in
	MUA code. Re-introduce options as and when users demand them.

	* ebdb-com.el: Remove `ebdb-pop-up-window-size' and
	 `ebdb-horiz-pop-up-window-size'.
	* ebdb-mua.el: Remove `ebdb-mua-pop-up-window-size' and
	 `ebdb-mua-horiz-pop-up-window-size'.  Remove let bindings from
	 various commands.
	* ebdb.org: Basic documentation of this.

2017-01-19  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Simplify the structure of ebdb-org-hashtable

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-init-field, ebdb-delete-field): These field-role
	 methods cache role information in ebdb-org-hashtable. The hash
	 entries used to be more complex, because roles originally didn't
	 store their record's uuid. They do now, so the entries can be much
	 simplified: simply a list of role fields, keyed to organizations'
	 uuids.
	 (ebdb-delete-record, ebdb-record-insert-field): Change access
	 accordingly.
	 (ebdb-record-add-org-role): Turn this into a method.
	* ebdb-format.el (ebdb-fmt-collect-fields): Change access accordingly.

2017-01-19  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Searching on empty strings should happen in field-search method

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-record-search): There's no reason to do the check
	 here.
	* ebdb.el (ebdb-field-search): Instead, do it here.  I suppose this
	 could even be an :around method on ebdb-field-search, to
	 short-circuit the test.

2017-01-19  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Install ebdb-save as a kill-emacs-hook

	* ebdb-com.el: Hope I don't regret this for any reason.

2017-01-18  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Allow company-ebdb to work in notmuch-message-mode as well

	* company-ebdb.el (company-ebdb-modes): How I wish notmuch didn't
	 hijack message-mode.

2017-01-18  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Make ebdb-search-read and ebdb-search-field into generics

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-search-read): Each field class has the potential to
	 prompt the user for its own search criteria, which are then fed back
	 to its own implementation of `ebdb-search-field'.
	 (ebdb-record-search): Fix the 'user implementation of this method,
	 now works with record labels again.
	* ebdb-com.el: Change interactive calls to `ebdb-search-read' to use
	 the field class instead of string prompt, where appropriate.
	* ebdb-org.el: Provide `ebdb-search-read' and `ebdb-field-search'
	 methods for the org tags class.

2017-01-18  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Change default separator of org tags

	* ebdb-org.el: Why was it a semicolon?

2017-01-18  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Tweaks to MUA interactive commands

	* ebdb-mua.el: Remove the update-p arg from everything, and fix up
	 `ebdb-mua-edit-field' so it actually works. Still needs heavy
	 refactoring, though.

2017-01-18  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Change default of ebdb-default-user-field

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-default-user-field): Use the field class symbol
	 instead of 'notes, it makes things much easier elsewhere.

2017-01-18  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Change default keybindings in Gnus

	* ebdb-gnus.el (ebdb-insinuate-gnus): ":" now does
	 ebdb-mua-update-records by default.

2017-01-17  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Update company-ebdb to work with new search style

	* company-ebdb.el (company-ebdb--candidates): `ebdb-search' takes its
	 arguments differently now.

2017-01-17  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add sections on searching and record marking to manual

2017-01-17  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Rework MUA window popups

	Fixes #14

	Refactoring still required.

	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-popup-window): Replace `ebdb-mua-window-p' with
	 this, a generic function in MUA packages that returns the window to
	 be split, and how to split it.
	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-pop-up-window): Rework function to accept value of
	 `ebdb-popup-window'.
	* ebdb-gnus.el: Implement `ebdb-popup-window'.
	* ebdb-message.el: Implement `ebdb-popup-window' (and fix some very
	 embarrassing mistakes).

2017-01-16  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Rework *EBDB* buffer searching

	Does not fix but does address #12

	BUG: Searching on the labels of ebdb-user-field-simple instances still 
	doesn't work correctly, but at least it errs on the side of 
	permissiveness.

	From a plumbing point of view, there's now a clear chain from 1) various
	interactive search commands that call 2)
	`ebdb-search-display', which is responsible for handling and displaying
	the records found by 3) `ebdb-search' which actually does the searching.

	From a UX point of view, most of the search commands can now be called 
	with one of three prefix keys: "/" which searches all records and 
	replaces the contents of the *EBDB* buffer, "|" which filters on the 
	already-displayed records, and "+" which appends to the 
	already-displayed records.

	This means that the `ebdb-append-*' stuff is gone.

	Meanwhile, `ebdb-search-invert' etc still exists, but has been moved to
	ebdb-com.el.

2017-01-16  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Many fixes to migration routine

	Fixes #15

	Thanks to Andy Cowling for reporting.

	* ebdb-migrate.el (ebdb-migrate-vector-to-class): Had accumulated many
	 small bugs.
	 (ebdb-migrate-parse-records): This is the weird part, no idea how
	 this had ever worked.
	* ebdb.el: Tweak requires and autoloads, as well as parts of the role
	 adoption routine.
	* ebdb-gnus.el: Autoload message-make-domain.

2017-01-16  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Split off ebdb-record-field for field classes

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-record-field): Move the cond branch checking if FIELD
	 is a field class into a separate method.

2017-01-16  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Another round of compiler-inspired fixes

2017-01-16  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Simplify role field adoption process

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-record-insert-field): Essentially the same function
	 had been written three times.
	 (ebdb-record-adopt-role-fields): Use this existing function in all
	 cases.

2017-01-16  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix to ebdb-parse with field-name-simple

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-parse): Was missing a "slots".

2017-01-16  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Improve organization searching

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-record-search): New methods that specialize on the
	 'organization symbol. Implement for person and organization records.
	 While we're at it, add a record-search implementation for
	 organizations and mails -- it should also check the domain slot.
	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-search-organization): Alter this accordingly.

2017-01-13  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix organization name matching in migration

	* ebdb-migrate.el (ebdb-migrate-from-bbdb): Organization name slots
	 are no longer plain strings.

2017-01-13  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add missing require statement

	* ebdb-org.el: Need to require 'ebdb.

2017-01-13  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Clean up keymap bindings

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-mode-map): Almost nothing but align-regexp on
	 source code.

2017-01-13  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix the reload process

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-db-reload): The actual database object needs to be
	 re-read from the persistence file.
	 (ebdb-db-unsynced): We should be checking modification time, not
	 access time. And use the provided accessor.

2017-01-13  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Expand ebdb-with-record-edits

	Fixes #13

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-with-record-edits): Provide more feedback and
	 choices to the user when the databases have problems. Should
	 actually work correctly now.

2017-01-13  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add a generic for ebdb-db-editable

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-db-editable): It's good to have the arg signature in
	 eldoc.

2017-01-13  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fill out the ebdb-parse process

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-parse): Use a generic so we can see the argument list.
	 Turn this into a "call-down" method that results in the creation of
	 a field instance. Provide a base method for the ebdb-field-name
	 class, that dispatches to either the simple or complex field class.
	 Later, the MUA record creation process should use this better. Tweak
	 the field-phone implementation so it conforms to the process.

2017-01-13  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Note new database-related commands in manual

	* ebdb.org: In the database section.

2017-01-13  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Split ebdb-db-disable into interactive/non-interactive functions

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-db-disable): Change function to method, remove
	 interactive elements.
	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-disable-database): New function providing
	 interactive elements of above. Provide keybindings, etc.

2017-01-13  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Still need to hash newly-added records

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-db-add-record): This is no longer the main spot for
	 uuid checking, but we still need to do it here -- it has to work for
	 newly-added records.

2017-01-13  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Omnibus changes to display and redisplay

	There are now only two basic functions: `ebdb-display-records' and
	`ebdb-redisplay-records'. The former simply fills an *EBDB* buffer with
	formatted records. The latter takes a list of records to be redisplayed,
	and an "action": how to redisplay them. It finds all the records that
	are visible in buffers, and applies "action" to them by calling the
	appropriate `ebdb-redisplay-record' method on each record. Record
	marking, omitting, unloading, format toggling, etc -- all these things
	are now implemented with the same system.

2017-01-10  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Use mail-decode-encoded-word-string on returned MUA headers

	* ebdb-mua.el (ebdb-get-address-components): Why was this not
	 happening before?

2017-01-10  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix merging procedure

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-merge): Don't prompt about alternate names unless the
	 names are actually different. Treat the notes field class correctly.

2017-01-10  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Make ebdb-record-name a get-or-get-and-set operation

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-record-name): If the cached string isn't there,
	 generate it.
	 (ebdb-init-record): Don't do the caching here.
	 (ebdb-string): This method for records should make use of
	 `ebdb-record-name'.

	This ought to work okay. It might shift a tiny bit of user wait time 
	from load/initialize, to the first search. Probably negligible.

2017-01-07  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Rename ebdb-display-one-record to ebdb-search-single-record

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-search-single-record): The "display" term was
	 causing confusion with other functions.

2017-01-07  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Remove ebdb-this-buffer-name

	Probably unnecessary, but we might want to pass a buffer in as first 
	argument to `ebdb-pop-up-window'.

2017-01-07  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Using wrong var name in ebdb-edit-field

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-edit-field): No wonder none of this seems to work.

2017-01-06  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Small tweaks to ebdb-load

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-load): Accept actual ebdb-db instances in the
	 ebdb-sources list, and make some other small changes.

2017-01-06  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Prevent eieio-persistent-save from changing db file slot

	Fixes #11

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-db-do-auto-save): Don't let the persistent save call
	 change the db filename to the autosave filename.

2017-01-05  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Re-init mail fields after moving them to a role

	* ebdb.el: (ebdb-record-adopt-role-fields): Mail field needs to be
	 re-initialized or it won't be hashed and cached.

2017-01-05  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Update company-ebdb to work

	* company-ebdb.el (company-ebdb--candidates): Very small tweak to get
	 it working again.

2017-01-05  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Use ebdb-defunct face on defunct role fields

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-fmt-field): This defunct face is ugly.

2017-01-04  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Autoload eieio-customize-object

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-edit-field): Don't require here.

2017-01-04  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Yet another method definition in the wrong place

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-field-mail-compose): Move below definition of
	 `ebdb-record-entity'

2017-01-04  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix mail field action

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-field-mail-compose): New method handling
	 ebdb-field-action for mail address fields.

2017-01-03  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Remove ebdb-mail-address

	* ebdb-com.el: We have `ebdb-copy-mail-as-kill' for that purpose, and
	 `ebdb-mail' doesn't need it.

2017-01-03  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	More fixes to merging logic in ebdb-db-load

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-db-load): Need to make sure right record ends up
	 getting hashed against the uuid. Also, probably a bad idea to be
	 let-binding the symbol 'equal.

2017-01-03  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix autoload for ebdb-org-field-tags definition

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-org-field-tags): Was still calling it
	 gnorb-ebdb-field-tags.

2017-01-03  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Restore mail alias functionality

	Closes #7

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-field-mail-alias): Expand mail alias field definition.
	 Field instances now hold the specific address to use when expanding
	 the alias.
	 (ebdb-mail-alias-alist): New defvar holding mail alias information.
	 As alias fields are created and deleted, this variable is changed.
	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-mail-aliases): Rework this function to read the
	 above variable.

	Deleted functions and variables: ebdb-mail-alias-list, 
	ebdb-add-mail-alias, ebdb-mail-aliases-need-rebuilt, 
	ebdb-mail-alias-field, ebdb-mail-alias.

2017-01-03  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Include record name when prompting for mail

	* ebdb.el: Slightly easier to use this way.

2017-01-03  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Improve ebdb-copy-mail-as-kill

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-copy-mail-as-kill): Now takes a prefix argument,
	 which prompts for which record mail address to use.

2017-01-03  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	 Add a "defunct" arg to ebdb-record-mail

	 * ebdb.el (ebdb-record-mail): Controlling whether we return defunct
	  mail addresses or not.
	  (ebdb-record-search): When searching mails, also search defunct
	  mails.

2017-01-03  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	ebdb-prompt-for-mail should return single mails with no prompt

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-prompt-for-mail): If there's only one mail, don't ask
	 about it.

2017-01-03  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	New function ebdb-prompt-for-mail

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-prompt-for-mail): Ask the user to choose one of a
	 record's mail addresses. Returns the actual mail class.

2017-01-01  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fixup bbdb-mode keymap, menu, and docstring

	* ebdb-com.el: Remove bindings for non-existent functions, add
	 bindings for new functions, fix up mode documentation.

2017-01-01  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Use eieio-object-p instead of vectorp

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-record-list): Sort of unnecessary, since vectorp
	 works.

2017-01-01  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Use save-excursion in ebdb-toggle-all-record-marks

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-toggle-all-record-marks): Leave point where it is.

2017-01-01  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	New ebdb-copy-mail-as-kill command

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-copy-mail-as-kill): Produces dwim-mail-style
	 strings for all marked records.

2017-01-01  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Remove ebdb-browse-url

	* ebdb-com.el: Superceded by ebdb-field-url action.

2016-12-31  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Change gnorb tags field to plain org tags field

	There was no reason to keep this under the gnorb package.

	* ebdb-org.el (ebdb-org-tags): Tags collection variable moves here.
	 (ebdb-org-field-tags): As does the class, plus its various methods.
	* ebdb-gnorb.el: Remove stuff from here.
	* ebdb-migrate.el (gnorb-ebdb-org-tag-field): Keep this in the
	 migration file, it's not good for anything else.
	 (ebdb-migrate-vector-to-class): Adjust the name of the class we're
	 creating.

2016-12-31  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Straighten out ebdb-separator-alist

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-separator-alist): Some drunk idiot hit "M-q" on this
	 defcustom at some point.

2016-12-31  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Improvements to the gnorb-ebdb-org-tags field

	* ebdb-gnorb.el (gnorb-ebdb-org-tags): New variable holding tags seen
	 by EBDB, to be combined with `org-global-tags-completion-table'.
	 (ebdb-read): Use `completing-read-multiple' with the tags.
	 (ebdb-init-field): Add all field's tags to `gnorb-ebdb-org-tags'.

2016-12-31  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Trailing code in last commit

	* ebdb-pgp.el: Fully remove ebdb-read-xfield-pgp-mail. Whoops.

2016-12-31  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Update ebdb-pgp

	Closes #9

	* ebdb-pgp.el (ebdb-field-pgp): New class holding the default
	 signing/encryption action for this record.
	 (ebdb-pgp): Update this function to use the class.
	* ebdb.el: Provide a defclass autoload.

2016-12-31  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix logic of loading records from multiple databases

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-db-load): This should now work correctly.

2016-12-31  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Remove ebdb-file-coding-system variable

	* ebdb.el: eieio-persistent objects are hard-coded to write
	 'utf-8-emacs, anyway.

2016-12-31  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Name classes now inherit from ebdb-field-user

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-field-name): Inherit name classes from
	 `ebdb-field-user', allowing users to choose what kind of name goes
	 in the aka slot.
	 (ebdb-field-name-complex): Change human-readable tag to "alt name".
	 (ebdb-field-name-simple): Change human-readable tag to "nickname".

	This required moving all the abstract field definitions higher in the 
	file.

2016-12-31  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix broken quoting for organization simple name reading

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-read): This was causing some weird errors.
	 (ebdb-record-change-name): This is probably unnecessary.

2016-12-31  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	ebdb-create-record: set record class outside of interactive call

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-create-record): Apparently the second interactive
	 argument can't refer to the first.

2016-12-31  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Mess with autoloads

	* ebdb.el: We were autoloading some functions that weren't actually
	 being used.  Also, try out `eieio-defclass-autoload', which seems
	 like it could save users some grief.
	 (ebdb-db-customize): Don't require eieio-custom, function is
	 autoloaded.

2016-12-31  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	When unloading, don't remove records from the db's record slot

	This probably will help with #11

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-db-unload): Records should not be removed from the
	 db's 'record slot, that will result in them getting deleted
	 altogether!  Just use `ebdb-delete-record' to get them out of the
	 secondary data structures, then remove the db from `ebdb-db-list'.

2016-12-31  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Do away with ebdb-seen-uuids

	Now that we're hashing uuids in the load process, this variable isn't 
	necessary at all.

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-delete-record): Don't need to remove the uuid here.
	 (ebdb-check-uuid): Just use the hashtable.
	 (ebdb-clear-vars): Remove from variables that need to be cleared.

2016-12-31  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Stop pretended init and delete are the same for records and fields

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-init-record, ebdb-delete-record, ebdb-delete-field,
	 ebdb-init-field): Four new generics.  Replace all `ebdb-init' and
	 `ebdb-delete' calls with their more-specific versions.

2016-12-31  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Protect against non-present records in role delete method

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-delete): This whole thing with the roles needs to be
	 reworked.

2016-12-31  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Provide ebdb-load guards in a few more places

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-completing-read-records): Make sure records are
	 loaded, if this is the point of entry.
	* ebdb.el (ebdb-prompt-for-db): Ditto, though I'm less sure about this
	one.

2016-12-31  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	New search command ebdb-search-record-class

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-search-record-class): Search by record class.
	 (ebdb-mode-map): Give it a keybinding.

2016-12-31  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add keybinding for ebdb-search-database

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-mode-map): Is that all of them?

2016-12-31  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add object-print method for records

	* ebdb.el (object-print): Slightly wishful thinking that we can
	 eventually use this in evaluation printing and backtraces, etc.

2016-12-29  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Remove mentions and bindings for ebdb-do-all-records

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-mode-map): This has been replaced by record
	 marking.

2016-12-29  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Use "d" prefix for record/database move commands

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-mode-map): We've still got "C-k" for
	 `ebdb-delete-field-or-record', which seems safer anyway. The "d" key
	 is now the prefix for commands `ebdb-copy-records' and
	 `ebdb-move-records'.

2016-12-29  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Make ebdb-display-records non-interactive

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-display-records): It's cleaner as a plain
	 function. Ensure that the "fmt" argument is present.
	 (ebdb-display-one-record): Replace its previous interactive use with
	 a dedicated function, that prompts for and displays a single record.
	 (ebdb-mode-map): Change mode map and menu accordingly.

2016-12-29  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix ebdb-search-duplicates

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-search-duplicates): Move it down with the other
	 search functions, and make sure it uses `ebdb-formatter-prefix' to
	 pass a format argument to `ebdb-display-records'.

2016-12-29  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Forgot about rmail

	* ebdb-rmail.el (ebdb-make-buffer-name): Add methods for rmail
	 major-modes.

	Merge branch 'buff'

	Closes #6

2016-12-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Additions to README and manual

2016-12-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Provide protection for relations to unloaded records

	For role and relation fields, don't blow up if the target record is not
	currently loaded.

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-init): Use a "record not loaded" string for role
	 fields.
	 (ebdb-string): And display something similar for relation fields.

2016-12-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Hash record uuids during the loading process

	As each record is loaded, hash its uuid.  This allows the use of
	`ebdb-gethash' uuid lookups later, during the initialization process.

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-init): Do not hash the uuid during record init.
	 (ebdb-db-load): Instead, hash during record load.
	 (ebdb-check-uuid): Now we can use `ebdb-gethash' in this function.
	 (ebdb-record-insert-field): And in the loading of role fields.

2016-12-28  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Move record initialization out of load process

	Part of the motivation of this is that initialization creates 
	connections between records.  If those records are living in separate 
	databases, then all databases need to be loaded before initialization 
	happens.

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-db-load): Don't initialize records here.
	 (ebdb-initialize): Instead, create a separate function for doing
	 that.
	 (ebdb-load): And call it here, after all databases are loaded.

2016-12-27  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add command to unmark all records

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-unmark-all-records): New command. Calling
	 redisplay for each individual record is highly inefficient when
	 unmarking lots of records.

2016-12-27  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Move point to next record when adding a mark

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-toggle-record-mark): Slightly more convenient, and
	 in line with other Emacs marking behavior.

2016-12-27  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Improve ebdb-field-user docstring

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-field-user): Make it clear what this does.

2016-12-27  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Merge branch 'master' into buff

2016-12-27  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add new ebdb-field-id field

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-field-id): Inherits ebdb-field-obfuscated, so won't
	 display in the *EBDB* buffer.	Inherits ebdb-field-labeled.
	 (ebdb-id-label-list): Label list for field instances.

2016-12-27  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add ebdb-field-obfuscated abstract field class

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-field-obfuscated): New abstract field class that
	 doesn't do anything but prevent the field contents from being
	 displayed in the *EBDB* buffer.
	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-fmt-field): When formatting the field, display a
	 bogus string instead.
	 (ebdb-field-hidden): Font face for that bogus string.

2016-12-27  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Select newly-cloned buffers

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-clone-buffer): This command should select the
	 resulting cloned buffer.  In fact, it should probably re-use the
	 existing window instead of popping up another, but that will require
	 a bit of refactoring of the pop-up code.

2016-12-27  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Document buffer manipulation commands in the manual

	* ebdb.org: New section "EBDB Buffers".

2016-12-27  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Stray "arg" arg left in create-record-extended

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-create-record-extended): Whoops.

2016-12-27  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Provide keybindings for clone-buffer and rename-buffer

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-mode-map): Under the "b"-for-buffer prefix.

2016-12-27  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Sort out catch-all version of ebdb-make-buffer-name

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-make-buffer-name): Apparently you do it with an
	 empty arg list.
	 (ebdb-display-records): Call the method.

2016-12-26  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	First commit of buffer improvements

	The only thing wrong with this (I hope), is that the catch-all default 
	implementation of `ebdb-make-buffer-name' still doesn't work -- the 
	specializer definition is wrong.

2016-12-26  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Remap binding of ebdb in *EBDB* buffers

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-mode-map): Don't use "b", as that's no longer
	 semantically relevant, and will be used as a buffer operation
	 prefix.

2016-12-26  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Don't auto-save unsynced databases

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-auto-save-databases): If a database is unsynced, skip
	 the autosave.

	This might have something to do with #11.  It's probably not the full 
	solution, but will probably avoid errors.  A real solution would be a
	deeper rethink of unsynced handling.

2016-12-24  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Change keybindings of record/field copy commands

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-mode-map): To avoid clashing with previous binding
	 for "C".

2016-12-24  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Switch to using kbd macro in keymap def

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-mode-map): Switch to kdb.

2016-12-24  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Better customization setup for record fields

	* ebdb.el: Add custom declarations for all field slots where it makes
	 sense.
	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-custom-field-record): Bookkeeping variable so we
	 can manipulate the record that owns the field being customized.
	 (ebdb-edit-field-customize): Edit a field using the customize
	 interface.
	 (eieio-done-customizing): After customization, mark the record as
	 dirty and redisplay it.

2016-12-24  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Add ebdb-search-database

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-search-database): Select a database and show all
	 its records.

2016-12-24  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Be more careful about text props in record headers

	Specifically, how the location of properties affects editing and 
	deletion of records/fields.

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-current-field): If point is at eol, scan backward
	 for field, otherwise scan forward
	 (ebdb-fmt-record-header): Add the actual name field as a property to
	 the cached name string.
	 (ebdb-edit-field): Be more careful about checking where point is.
	 (ebdb-delete-field-or-record): Ditto.

2016-12-24  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Fix quoting bug in ebdb-fmt-record-header

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-fmt-record-header): Quotes were eating variable
	 value of text property.

2016-12-24  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Complement ebdb-create-record with ebdb-create-record-extended

	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-create-record): No longer checks prefix arg to see
	 if we should do extended querying.
	 (ebdb-create-record-extended): This command does the querying, and
	 passes the args to above function.

	Provide separate keybindings for the two commands. This is part of the 
	move to provide double versions of commands, "plain" and "extended", 
	bound to lower-case and upper-case versions of the same key.

2016-12-24  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Forgot extra argument to ebdb-delete-i18n

	* ebdb-chn.el (ebdb-delete-i18n): Needs to accept (and ignore) the
	 unload argument. The real fix here will be separating out these
	 major methods into different versions for records and fields.

2016-12-24  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Change interactive defs for move/copy-records

	* ebdb.el (ebdb-move-record, ebdb-copy-records):  These should be
	 "internal", non-interactive functions.
	* ebdb-com.el (ebdb-move-records, ebdb-copy-records): New *EBDB*
	 buffer commands that call the underlying functions.

2016-12-23  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>

	Squash "prep" branch, push to Github

2016-05-14  Eric Abrahamsen  <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>
